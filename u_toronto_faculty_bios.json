During his doctoral studies, Jean-Christophe was the McMurty Fellow of the Osgoode Society for Canadian Legal History and a Joseph-Armand Bombardier Scholar. He has done consultancy work on constitution-building for International IDEA and, prior to his graduate studies, he worked in litigation for the Quebec Department of Justice.B\u00e9dard-Rubin\u00a0currently pursues two main research projects. The first is an intellectual history of the foundations of public law in French Canada. This project seeks to reconstruct the intellectual networks in which French Canadian public lawyers participated to excavate the transatlantic influences on the formation of Quebec\u2019s legal syncretism. This genealogical reconstruction recovers the conceptual and theoretical innovations that allowed French Canadians to articulate a genuine theory of the state outside of the revolutionary framework. In so doing, this work sheds a different, somewhat oblique light on Canada\u2019s constitutional experience and questions its status in comparative constitutional scholarship.The second research project investigates judicial bilingualism in Canada. Using mixed social science methods, this project explores the various empirical impacts of bilingualism on judicial behaviour, the normative significance of legal bilingualism for the authority of judicial decisions, and the ways in which language shapes the dominant conception of the judicial role in Canada\u2019s French and English public spheres.Jean-Christophe\u2019s work has been published in English and French in the\u00a0Review of Constitutional Studies, the\u00a0Canadian Journal of Law & Society, the\u00a0Osgoode Hall Law Journal, the\u00a0Bulletin d\u2019histoire politique, and the\u00a0International Journal of Canadian Studies, amongst others.\nResearch areasCanadian Constitutional Law",

During her tenure as a Member of Provincial Parliament, Des Rosiers served in the cabinet of Kathleen Wynne as Minister of Natural Resources and Forestry.She was born in Montreal, studied law at the Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al and received a LLM from Harvard University. Des Rosiers clerked at the Supreme Court of Canada and practised law in London, Ontario with Lerners LLP. She also was a law professor at the University of Western Ontario.

Des Rosiers served as general counsel for the Canadian Civil Liberties Association (CCLA) from 2009 to 2013,[ when she returned to serve as dean of the common law section at the University of Ottawa until 2016.During the 2010 G20 Toronto summit, Des Rosiers uncovered a provision invoked by the provincial government which greatly expanded police powers near a security fence on the perimeter of the summit's location. She brought this issue to the attention of the Canadian press and ensured that CCLA volunteers monitored the Toronto police for civil liberties violations during the conference. She also helped to discourage the practice of \"carding\", where police stop people who are not suspected of any criminal activity, ask for their identification and record that information for later review.Des Rosiers was inducted into the Order of Ontario in 2012 and was inducted as a Member of the Order of Canada in 2013 for her work in civil rights and Francophone advocacy and was accepted as a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada in 2014. She was named one of Canada's 10 \"nation builders\" by the Globe and Mail in 2014 and was named one of Canada's 25 most influential lawyers by Canadian Lawyer in 2011 and in 2012.",

Harney Chair in Ethnic, Immigration and Pluralism Studies\r\nProfessor of Law, Political Science & Global Affairs, and former Canada Research Chair in Citizenship and Multiculturalism\nJackman Law Building78 Queen's ParkToronto, Ontario M5S 2C5\nAyelet Shachar (FRSC) is Professor of Law, Political Science, and Global Affairs, and the holder of the R.F. Harney Chair in Ethnic, Immigration and Pluralism Studies at the University of Toronto, where she directs the Harney Program at the Munk School of Global Affairs & Public Policy. Previously, she was a Scientific Member of the Max Planck Society\u2014one of the foremost research organizations in the world\u2014and Director at the Max Planck Institute for the Study of Religious and Ethnic Diversity. She was awarded the\u00a0Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize in 2019. Before her recruitment to the Max Planck Society, she held the Canada Research Chair in Citizenship and Multiculturalism. At\u00a0Goethe University Frankfurt she is affiliated with both the Faculty of Law and the Normative Orders Research Centre, where she is the leader of the \"Transformations of Citizenship\" research group.\u00a0Shachar has published extensively on the topics of citizenship theory, immigration law, cultural diversity and women's rights, new border regimes, highly skilled migration and global inequality, and the marketization of citizenship. Her research is motivated by the need to develop new legal principles to address some of the most pressing issues of our time: how to live together in diverse societies, how to grant rights to those who lack formal access to membership, and how to tame the ever-expanding reach of borders and migration control in a world of persistent inequality.Shachar\u00a0is the author of Multicultural Jurisdictions: Cultural Differences and Women's Rights\u00a0(Cambridge University Press, 2001 & 2009), for which she won the American Political Science Association\u00a02002 Foundations of\u00a0Political Theory Section Best First Book Award. This work\u00a0has inspired a new generation of thinking about how to best mitigate the tensions between gender equality and religious diversity. It has also proved influential in the real world, intervening\u00a0in actual public policy and legislative debates. It has been\u00a0cited by, among others, England's Archbishop of Canterbury\u00a0(who described Shachar's work as \"highly original and significant\"), Ontario's Ministry of the Attorney General,\u00a0and the Supreme Court of Canada.\u00a0Over the last twenty years, Multicultural Jurisdictions has become a key reference point for feminist approaches to the study of law and religion.Shachar's work combines \"big ideas\" from law and political theory with innovative problem-solving and institutional design. The Birthright Lottery: Citizenship and Global Inequality (Harvard University Press, 2009) was\u00a0named 2010 International Ethics Notable Book in recognition of its \"superior scholarship and contribution to the field of international ethics.\" It has created a groundswell of interest among policymakers and academics alike. Located at the intersection of law, economics, and political philosophy, The Birthright Lottery crafts new legal concepts and innovative institutional designs to promote global justice, with the aim of ameliorating the most glaring opportunity inequalities that attach to this system of allocation in today's world.\u00a0This work has been the topic of special-issue symposiums, international workshops and roundtables, and the subject of\u00a0essays that have appeared in\u00a0professional and interdisciplinary publications, including the American Journal\u00a0of Comparative Law, Ethics & International Affairs, Harvard Law Review,\u00a0Issues in Legal Scholarship, La\u00a0Revue Nouvelle,\u00a0Political Theory, Rorotoko, Nexus, Edge, Tikkun, and the Literary Review of Canada.\u00a0\u00a0Shachar is also the lead editor of the field-defining The Oxford Handbook of Citizenship (Oxford University Press, 2017 & 2020).\u00a0This work has already emerged as a major reference work in the field for those engaged with citizenship from a philosophical, political, legal and cultural perspective. It has been described by Joseph Weiler as: \u201cThe definitive source on a critical concept in political and social life. Innovative in its conception and authoritative in its excitation.\u201d\u00a0Pratap Mehta observes that \u201c[n]o other single volume achieves the theoretical acuity, historical depth, legal grounding, and sociological analysis of citizenship that this book manages to achieve. It is clear, wide ranging, and admirably un-parochial in the range of its references.\u201dShachar newest book, The Shifting Border: Legal\u00a0Cartographies\u00a0of Migration and Mobility\u00a0(Critical Powers Series, Manchester University Press, 2020; shortlisted for the 2022 C.B. Macpherson Prize),\u00a0critically examines the role of territory and new measures of managed migration control in selectively restricting - or, conversely, accelerating - mobility and access to the world\u2019s prosperous countries, as governments seek to regain control over a crucial realm of their allegedly waning sovereign authority. Here, as in her previous writings, Shachar not only reveals the deep currents that are reshaping the terrain of law and mobility, but also seeks to develop innovative legal responses to break the current deadlock as she seeks to refute the claim that applicable solutions are beyond reach or impossible to imagine. This work appears under the auspices of the Critical Powers Series, which is \u201cdedicated to constructing dialogues around innovative and original work in social and political theory\u201d.The Shifting Border has been described by Hiroshi Motomura as \u201ca remarkable book. Essential for understanding government responses to people on the move, Shachar\u2019s vivid description, analytical precision, and reasoned persuasion combine to challenge conventional wisdom about \u2018borders\u2019 and how they work. The result: exceptional insights into how migration control can be more just. The Shifting Border offers an indispensable roadmap to immigration and refugee debates all around the world\". A recent LSE book review opines: \"In her impressive book, The Shifting Border, Ayelet Shachar refuses to adhere to what she views as false dichotomies between traditional approaches to a concept (culture, citizenship, borders) and premature diagnoses of the concept\u2019s demise. The force of her argument is consistently oriented towards rethinking the question, offering a new framework to understanding the world. \u2026 Shachar\u2019s innovative framework nicely exemplifies the shift from idealized ethical debates to institutional and political analysis.\"\u00a0\"Reading this essay by Shachar...is like getting the dream dinner invitation to hear cutting-edge thought on borders\" (CHOICE magazine).\u00a0\u00a0Shachar is a global citizen at heart and the recipient of research excellence awards in four different countries (Canada, Israel, Germany, and the United States). She has presented her work across the world and held visiting professorships in leading universities, including the Leah Kaplan Visiting Professor\u00a0in Human Rights\u00a0at Stanford Law School and the Jeremiah Smith Jr. Visiting Professor of Law at Harvard Law School.\u00a0She was also a Member of the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton, Fulbright Fellow, Distinguished Visiting Scholar at\u00a0Princeton\u2019s Law and Public Affairs Program (LAPA), Emile No\u00ebl Senior Fellow at NYU School of Law, Visiting Scholar at Harvard's Edmond J. Safra Center for Ethics, and the W. M. Keck Fellow in Legal Ethics\u00a0and Professional Culture at Yale Law School. In recognition of her excellence in research and teaching as a faculty member at Toronto, she has received the University's Provostial Merit Increase Award for five consecutive years. Her work has appeared in leading law reviews,\u00a0social science, and political philosophy journals, including the\u00a0Yale Law Journal,\u00a0Journal of Political Philosophy, Ethics & International Affairs,\u00a0NYU Law Review, University of Chicago Law Review,\u00a0Yale Journal of Law & the Humanities, Philosophy and Social Criticism, Jurisprudence,\u00a0Political Theory, Perspectives on Politics, and\u00a0Theoretical Inquiries in Law.\u00a0Beyond contributing to key scholarly debates, she has provided pro-bono consultation to judges, non-governmental organizations, the European Parliamentary Research Services, and the World Bank. She is a member of the Board of Trustees of the Association of Members of the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton; the Advisory Board of the Boundaries, Membership & Belonging program of the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR); and the Advisory Board of the Max Planck-Cambridge Centre for Ethics, Economics, and Social Change at the University of Cambridge.\u00a0Shachar\u00a0earned\u00a0her\u00a0LL.B\u00a0in law and B.A. in political science, summa cum laude, from Tel Aviv University; LL.M. and J.S.D, both from Yale Law School.\u00a0Before arriving at Yale, she\u00a0was law clerk to Chief Justice Aharon Barak of the Supreme Court of Israel. She sits on the editorial boards of major peer-reviewed journals and book series in her field, and has delivered countless talks on her research in a range of academic, policy, and\u00a0popular venues\u00a0across the globe.\u00a0In 2014, she was elected Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada. In 2015, she became Director of the Max Planck Institute for the Study of Religious and Ethnic Diversity.
