Rabiat Akande works in the fields of legal history, law and religion, constitutional and comparative constitutional law, Islamic law, international law, and (post)colonial African law and society. Her research explores law\u2019s interplay with global inequality. She investigates this relationship in the historical setting of Europe\u2019s nineteenth and twentieth-century empire, especially in its encounter with Africa and the Muslim World. Her work further grapples with the afterlife of that encounter for law, unveiling legacies that resound far beyond erstwhile colonies. In her recent book, Entangled Domains: Empire, Law and Religion in Northern Nigeria (Cambridge University Press, 2023), Dr. Akande investigates the case of the British imperial encounter in Colonial Northern Nigeria. In particular, the book chronicles contestations between British colonial officials, Christian missionaries, and indigenous Muslim elites over law\u2019s governance religious difference, and grapples with the postcolonial legacy of those struggles.

During his doctoral studies, Jean-Christophe was the McMurty Fellow of the Osgoode Society for Canadian Legal History and a Joseph-Armand Bombardier Scholar. He has done consultancy work on constitution-building for International IDEA and, prior to his graduate studies, he worked in litigation for the Quebec Department of Justice.B\u00e9dard-Rubin currently pursues two main research projects. The first is an intellectual history of the foundations of public law in French Canada. This project seeks to reconstruct the intellectual networks in which French Canadian public lawyers participated to excavate the transatlantic influences on the formation of Quebec\u2019s legal syncretism. This genealogical reconstruction recovers the conceptual and theoretical innovations that allowed French Canadians to articulate a genuine theory of the state outside of the revolutionary framework. In so doing, this work sheds a different, somewhat oblique light on Canada\u2019s constitutional experience and questions its status in comparative constitutional scholarship.The second research project investigates judicial bilingualism in Canada. Using mixed social science methods, this project explores the various empirical impacts of bilingualism on judicial behaviour, the normative significance of legal bilingualism for the authority of judicial decisions, and the ways in which language shapes the dominant conception of the judicial role in Canada\u2019s French and English public spheres.Jean-Christophe\u2019s work has been published in English and French in the Review of Constitutional Studies, the Canadian Journal of Law & Society, the Osgoode Hall Law Journal, the Bulletin d\u2019histoire politique, and the International Journal of Canadian Studies, amongst others.

Harney Chair in Ethnic, Immigration and Pluralism Studies\r Professor of Law, Political Science & Global Affairs, and former Canada Research Chair in Citizenship and Multiculturalism Jackman Law Building78 Queen's ParkToronto, Ontario M5S 2C5 Ayelet Shachar (FRSC) is Professor of Law, Political Science, and Global Affairs, and the holder of the R.F. Harney Chair in Ethnic, Immigration and Pluralism Studies at the University of Toronto, where she directs the Harney Program at the Munk School of Global Affairs & Public Policy. Previously, she was a Scientific Member of the Max Planck Society\u2014one of the foremost research organizations in the world\u2014and Director at the Max Planck Institute for the Study of Religious and Ethnic Diversity. She was awarded the Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize in 2019. Before her recruitment to the Max Planck Society, she held the Canada Research Chair in Citizenship and Multiculturalism. At Goethe University Frankfurt she is affiliated with both the Faculty of Law and the Normative Orders Research Centre, where she is the leader of the \"Transformations of Citizenship\" research group. Shachar has published extensively on the topics of citizenship theory, immigration law, cultural diversity and women's rights, new border regimes, highly skilled migration and global inequality, and the marketization of citizenship. Her research is motivated by the need to develop new legal principles to address some of the most pressing issues of our time: how to live together in diverse societies, how to grant rights to those who lack formal access to membership, and how to tame the ever-expanding reach of borders and migration control in a world of persistent inequality.Shachar is the author of Multicultural Jurisdictions: Cultural Differences and Women's Rights (Cambridge University Press, 2001 & 2009), for which she won the American Political Science Association 2002 Foundations of Political Theory Section Best First Book Award. This work has inspired a new generation of thinking about how to best mitigate the tensions between gender equality and religious diversity. It has also proved influential in the real world, intervening in actual public policy and legislative debates. It has been cited by, among others, England's Archbishop of Canterbury (who described Shachar's work as \"highly original and significant\"), Ontario's Ministry of the Attorney General, and the Supreme Court of Canada. Over the last twenty years, Multicultural Jurisdictions has become a key reference point for feminist approaches to the study of law and religion.Shachar's work combines \"big ideas\" from law and political theory with innovative problem-solving and institutional design. The Birthright Lottery: Citizenship and Global Inequality (Harvard University Press, 2009) was named 2010 International Ethics Notable Book in recognition of its \"superior scholarship and contribution to the field of international ethics.\" It has created a groundswell of interest among policymakers and academics alike. Located at the intersection of law, economics, and political philosophy, The Birthright Lottery crafts new legal concepts and innovative institutional designs to promote global justice, with the aim of ameliorating the most glaring opportunity inequalities that attach to this system of allocation in today's world. This work has been the topic of special-issue symposiums, international workshops and roundtables, and the subject of essays that have appeared in professional and interdisciplinary publications, including the American Journal of Comparative Law, Ethics & International Affairs, Harvard Law Review, Issues in Legal Scholarship, La Revue Nouvelle, Political Theory, Rorotoko, Nexus, Edge, Tikkun, and the Literary Review of Canada.  Shachar is also the lead editor of the field-defining The Oxford Handbook of Citizenship (Oxford University Press, 2017 & 2020). This work has already emerged as a major reference work in the field for those engaged with citizenship from a philosophical, political, legal and cultural perspective. It has been described by Joseph Weiler as: \u201cThe definitive source on a critical concept in political and social life. Innovative in its conception and authoritative in its excitation.\u201d Pratap Mehta observes that \u201c[n]o other single volume achieves the theoretical acuity, historical depth, legal grounding, and sociological analysis of citizenship that this book manages to achieve. It is clear, wide ranging, and admirably un-parochial in the range of its references.\u201dShachar newest book, The Shifting Border: Legal Cartographies of Migration and Mobility (Critical Powers Series, Manchester University Press, 2020; shortlisted for the 2022 C.B. Macpherson Prize), critically examines the role of territory and new measures of managed migration control in selectively restricting - or, conversely, accelerating - mobility and access to the world\u2019s prosperous countries, as governments seek to regain control over a crucial realm of their allegedly waning sovereign authority. Here, as in her previous writings, Shachar not only reveals the deep currents that are reshaping the terrain of law and mobility, but also seeks to develop innovative legal responses to break the current deadlock as she seeks to refute the claim that applicable solutions are beyond reach or impossible to imagine. This work appears under the auspices of the Critical Powers Series, which is \u201cdedicated to constructing dialogues around innovative and original work in social and political theory\u201d.The Shifting Border has been described by Hiroshi Motomura as \u201ca remarkable book. Essential for understanding government responses to people on the move, Shachar\u2019s vivid description, analytical precision, and reasoned persuasion combine to challenge conventional wisdom about \u2018borders\u2019 and how they work. The result: exceptional insights into how migration control can be more just. The Shifting Border offers an indispensable roadmap to immigration and refugee debates all around the world\". A recent LSE book review opines: \"In her impressive book, The Shifting Border, Ayelet Shachar refuses to adhere to what she views as false dichotomies between traditional approaches to a concept (culture, citizenship, borders) and premature diagnoses of the concept\u2019s demise. The force of her argument is consistently oriented towards rethinking the question, offering a new framework to understanding the world. \u2026 Shachar\u2019s innovative framework nicely exemplifies the shift from idealized ethical debates to institutional and political analysis.\" \"Reading this essay by Shachar...is like getting the dream dinner invitation to hear cutting-edge thought on borders\" (CHOICE magazine).  Shachar is a global citizen at heart and the recipient of research excellence awards in four different countries (Canada, Israel, Germany, and the United States). She has presented her work across the world and held visiting professorships in leading universities, including the Leah Kaplan Visiting Professor in Human Rights at Stanford Law School and the Jeremiah Smith Jr. Visiting Professor of Law at Harvard Law School.

In recognition of her excellence in research and teaching as a faculty member at Toronto, she has received the University's Provostial Merit Increase Award for five consecutive years. Her work has appeared in leading law reviews, social science, and political philosophy journals, including the Yale Law Journal, Journal of Political Philosophy, Ethics & International Affairs, NYU Law Review, University of Chicago Law Review, Yale Journal of Law & the Humanities, Philosophy and Social Criticism, Jurisprudence, Political Theory, Perspectives on Politics, and Theoretical Inquiries in Law. Beyond contributing to key scholarly debates, she has provided pro-bono consultation to judges, non-governmental organizations, the European Parliamentary Research Services, and the World Bank.

Shachar earned her LL.B in law and B.A. in political science, summa cum laude, from Tel Aviv University; LL.M. and J.S.D, both from Yale Law School. Before arriving at Yale, she was law clerk to Chief Justice Aharon Barak of the Supreme Court of Israel. She sits on the editorial boards of major peer-reviewed journals and book series in her field, and has delivered countless talks on her research in a range of academic, policy, and popular venues across the globe.

Previously she worked as a lawyer and researcher at the Indigenous Law Research Unit (University of Victoria Faculty of Law), and as a staff lawyer at West Coast Environmental Law. In both positions she provided legal support to Indigenous communities and organizations engaged in the revitalization of their own laws for application in contemporary contexts. She has worked on community-engaged projects with different legal traditions including Anishinaabe, Denezhu, Hai\u0301\u026bzaqv, Nlaka\u2019pamux, nuuc\u030caan\u0313u\u0142, St\u2019\u00e1t\u2019imc, Syilx and Tsilhqot\u2019in. She is particularly passionate about the possibilities within land-based legal education, and since 2014 she has co-facilitated various \u2018on-the-land\u2019, community-engaged Anishinaabe Law Camps in partnership with different law schools and communities across Ontario. Her book Otter\u2019s Journey Through Indigenous Language and Law (UBC Press, 2018) explores the connections between language and law. Lindsay is Anishinaabe and a member of the Chippewas of Nawash First Nation. Research topics Indigenous Legal Methods; Indigenous Environmental Law and Ecological Governance; Select Topics of Anishinaabe Law (child well-being, human rights, criminal, torts, and the environment); Field School Courses in Indigenous Legal Traditions; and Indigenous Child Well-Being Research focus statement Indigenous peoples across Canada face serious challenges that require the application of law in its most healing forms to enable the necessary transformations towards a more just society. Indigenous peoples\u2019 own laws are an essential component of confronting these challenges encountered within and beyond their communities. Lindsay Borrows\u2019 work examines the different sources from which Indigenous laws flow including for example custom, deliberation, stories, songs, ceremony, dances, language, legislation, treaties (etc.). She also studies the methods people use to draw out law from these sources. Prof. Borrows is particularly interested in an emergent area of Indigenous legal research\u2014looking to the natural world as legal precedent and exploring how reading the land as a legal archive introduces innovative practices of deliberation, decision-making, and dispute-resolution.

He earned his PhD in Politics from Princeton University, his JD from Yale Law School, and his AB in Applied Mathematics-Economics from Brown University, where he graduated magna cum laude. At Princeton, Ewing was a Laurance S. Rockefeller Graduate Prize Fellow in the University Center for Human Values. While a law student at Yale, he was a Coker Fellow and, in the fall of 2009, a research assistant to Associate Justice Stephen Breyer of the Supreme Court of the United States. In his scholarship, Ewing analyzes the moral and political foundations of different forms of legal responsibility for wrongdoing, particularly criminal punishment. He is especially interested in what it means to have a fair opportunity to avoid crime and punishment. He has developed a distinctive interpretation of fair opportunity to avoid crime that helps explain, among other things, the moral significance at sentencing of whether a defendant came from an unfairly disadvantaged background or committed prior offenses.

She is a member of the Ontario and Illinois bars, Associate member, Garden Court Chambers, UK, sits on the boards of the UK-based Tax Justice Network and the steering committee of its global parent, the Global Alliance for Tax Justice, and specializes in tax, corporate, gender, international tax, property, and human rights law. Her current research revolves around three core questions: Until substantive equality of outcomes for all individuals can be attained, how can societies eliminate deeply- rooted structural inequalities and discriminatory practices? How can the power and wealth concentrated in global 'north' corporations and individuals through unequal property, political, tax, and budget laws be replaced with redistributive programs that maintain individual sustain\/abilities throughout life? And, what truths arise from Indigenous and diverse peoples' living knowledges and learnings about how to match rates of human innovation and development with the evolutionary rates of other members of the biosphere in order to increase the sustain\/abilities of all forms of life? She has pursued these questions while on numerous government commissions, while meeting with and advising governments, civil society, academic groups in Canada, across China and on every continent, as well as when working with the European Parliament, EU governments, the UN and other treaty bodies, international financial institutions, and with Indigenous, circumpolar Arctic, human rights, and diverse peoples' organizations, watching and learning how to expand current research and dissemination methods capable of addressing these increasingly urgent issues.

She completed her undergraduate degree at Queen\u2019s before earning postgraduate degrees in Economics (MA, PhD) at the University of British Columbia, later returning to Queen\u2019s to obtain her LLB. Following completion of her LL.B., she clerked at the Federal Court of Appeal and for former Justice Ian Binnie at the Supreme Court of Canada. She then completed her LLM at Yale on a Fulbright scholarship before joining the faculty. Professor Metcalf\u2019s research often draws on her graduate training in economics. She has used economic theory and empirical methods to study Indigenous rights, including the Supreme Court\u2019s s. 35 Aboriginal rights cases, considering impacts on governance, rights holders and resource industry participants. Another research strand relates to the role of law, especially constitutional rights, in influencing individuals\u2019 decisions, preferences and broader social norms. Professor Metcalf also studies issues in environmental and resource law more generally and her most recent work is focused on climate change. Her research has been published in journals including the Northwestern University Law Review, International Review of Law & Economics, Canadian Public Policy, University of Toronto Law Journal, Journal of Empirical Legal Studies, & Queen\u2019s Law Journal. Together with her co-author, Ian Keay, she was twice awarded the Vanderkamp prize for best paper in Canadian Public Policy. She frequently presents her work internationally at conferences and invited seminars. She has recently received grants from the Social Science & Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC) and the Canadian Foundation for Legal Research. She has been an invited visiting scholar at the University of Colorado Faculty of Law & Institute of Behavioral Sciences Institutions Program, and Vancouver School of Economics at UBC. Professor Metcalf\u2019s teaching at Queen\u2019s spans the areas of her research interests, and includes public law, constitutional law, law and economics, international environmental and resource law and (occasionally) property law. She has also coached the Queen\u2019s Laskin moot team, together with Queen\u2019s Law alumna Pam Hrick (LEAF). She served as Associate Dean Academic at the faculty from 2015-2018.

Macpherson at the University of Toronto, where she completed her first two degrees before taking up a Commonwealth Scholarship to do a doctorate at Balliol College, Oxford. Sypnowich has held teaching appointments at Oxford University, Leeds University, Leiden University, University of California (San Diego), and York University, before coming to Queen\u2019s. She has been awarded visiting fellowships at the Australian National University, Corpus Christi College, Oxford, and All Souls College, Oxford. She is also a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada. Christine Sypnowich\u2019s early work was in the philosophy of law, particularly the possibility of socialist legality given the Marxist antipathy to law. This was the subject of her first monograph published with OUP, a revised version of her Oxford dissertation. More recently her research has centred on egalitarianism, making the case for a human flourishing approach to equality in Equality Renewed: Justice, Human Flourishing and the Egalitarian Ideal (Routledge 2018). She has published over 60 essays as journal articles or book chapters. Her work has been translated into Chinese, Russian and Spanish and abridged versions published in accessible formats such as textbooks and popular philosophy. She is currently completing a book on the philosophy of G.A. Cohen for Polity Press. Active in the city of Kingston as an advocate for transparency at City Hall as well as heritage conservation, Sypnowich is also working on a monograph on the political philosophy of cultural heritage.

In your legal career you\u2019ll likely represent plaintiffs and defendants in many court actions, and you\u2019ll likely argue many preliminary motions, but mostly you\u2019ll achieve your client\u2019s objectives negotiating deals and settlements or working with a mediator to resolve disputes. And that\u2019s why my absolute favourite thing is designing the experiential learning activities for our first year Dispute Resolution and Professional Responsibility course where we introduce basic conflict analysis, interviewing, negotiation, and mediation advocacy skills along with professional responsibility and ethics. The DRPR course puts the substantive law you learn in other first-year courses into the context of real client problems and real ethical dilemmas. You\u2019ll interview clients, consider multiple approaches and solutions to client situations, choose among dispute resolution processes, negotiate and mediate agreements and disputes, practice oral advocacy in a non-litigation setting, and write a case analysis memo on a professional responsibility problem and a client advice letter. You\u2019ll become familiar with the Rules of Professional Conduct, grapple with ethical dilemmas, and consider what it takes to be culturally competent and to ensure access to justice. And, in keeping with the new reality of lawyer\u2019s work, you\u2019ll learn both in person and online skills. DRPR is my signature course. I introduced it over 25 years ago. The course is as real as we can make it. We train upper-year students as clients and each year over 50 legal practitioners participate as demonstrators and coaches for our capstone activity. And because the course always incorporated online learning strategies, when the Covid 19 shut down in-person courses, we had the know how to pivot to fully online course delivery. As a bonus for me, I\u2019ve used my dispute resolution skills to design and deliver courses to medical professionals and medical trainees on \u201craising conflict productively\u201d and negotiation. Great Lawyers are Great Writers \u2013 The Legal Writing Academy Now, my other absolute favourite thing is the Legal Writing Academy programing. Here\u2019s where I combine my passion for pedagogy with ensuring that UOttawa law graduates are confident and competent writers. The ability to write clearly, concisely, and persuasively is a core competence for every lawyer regardless of their career path. I take pride in our first-year workshops, DRPR writing modules, Civil Procedure memo module, Writing Leader\u2019s program, Dean\u2019s Fellows, Social Justice writing courses, and ten, upper-year Write with Purpose seminars. Students can meet with an upper-year Writing Leader to work on strategies to overcome writer\u2019s block and recognize, correct, and avoid typical writing problems. And our award-winning www.Pointfirstwriting.com website gives you just-in-time access to modules on writing legal memo and editing your own work. Experiential learning drives every component of the Legal Academy programming. We combine real life writing tasks with personalized and frequent feedback and mentoring, and presentations by practitioner experts. We emphasize student self-reflection, goal setting, and life-long learning strategies. We pilot new courses and new approaches to writing instruction. We\u2019ve run our first online summer course, Legal Memos Made Easy, designed for students to study at their own pace while working full time. Stay tuned for new initiatives. My Three Favourite Research Projects \u2013 Projects that Stretched my Brain Charitable Gifts of Conservation Easements: Lessons from the US Experience in Enhancing the Tax Incentive, Canadian Tax Journal (2010) vol. 58, no 1, 25 - 61 (co-author Karen Cooper). Researching the impact of the charitable tax credit on preserving eco-sensitive land let me delve into the science and economics of ecosystem services, climate change, environmental and behavioural economics. I learned a lot. A second branch of the project became a series of presentations that we thought had more punch than an academic article. What Sticks: How Medical Residents and Academic Health Care Faculty Transfer Conflict Resolution Training from the Workshop to the Workplace (Spring 2008) 3:25 Conflict Resolution Quarterly 321-350 (co-authors Goldstein, R, Manwaring, J. Marks, M.). Working with the faculty of medicine on training medical faculty and residents in raising conflict productively, led to an interdisciplinary study of what program participants actually took away and could apply in their work at the hospital and on research team. I learned new social science research techniques. The research had a double-back effect; we learned what worked and what we could change for greater impact. Legal Memos Made Easy and Edit Your Own Work on www.Pointfirstwriting.com These companion modules teach the practical skills of writing legal memos and a five-layered approach to editing. Each layer concentrates on a different task, keeping students and other users from being overwhelmed by fixing everything at once. Chunked sub-parts allow students to practice skills multiple times on a variety of documents and apply online feedback incrementally to drafts. The website is used in writing seminars and to support students writing assignments and major papers. Students can self-study anytime. And graduates tell us they return to the website in their first years of practice and share the site with colleagues at work. The website content and activities reflect years of studying how we learn and delving into online learning strategies. Teaching Awards \u2013 We don\u2019t teach or innovate for awards.
