am an Associate Professor at Osgoode Hall Law School. I am also a research Fellow at the Dahdaleh Institute for Global Health Research at York University, and a Senior Fellow at Melbourne University Law School. My first book, All Is Well: Catastrophe and the Making of the Normal State was published by Oxford University Press in 2022. In All Is Well, I offer a history of the mutually constitutive relationship between disasters and states during the eighteenth-century and show the enduring influence of the underlying narratives, instincts, techniques, and practices on global disaster management today. I am currently working on two book projects. The first examines the history of war, environmental degradation\/disasters, and human displacement from 1860 to the present. This research is funded by a Social Sciences and Humanities Council Insight Development Grant and supported by Osgoode Hall Law School, York University\u2019s Center for Refugee Studies, and the Dahdaleh Institute for Global Health Research. The second book project presents a legal and environmental history of the relationship between the international environmentalism movement of the 1960s and 70s, and contemporary global crises of food insecurity and climate change. I have published in encyclopedias, edited volumes and in legal and interdisciplinary journals such as the University of British Columbia Law Review, the Fordham Environmental Law Review, Global Jurist, the Indian Journal of International Law, and the Journal of Intellectual Property Rights. I occasionally write essays and book reviews for public facing periodicals and websites and have developed several case studies for Harvard Law School\u2019s Case Studies Program. During 2016-2017, I was a Visiting Professor and Catalyst Fellow at Osgoode, and an adjunct faculty at Northeastern University School of Law. I hold an SJD, an interdisciplinary doctorate from Harvard Law School, LLMs from Harvard Law School and American University\u2019s Washington College of Law, and a BA LLB (with honors) from the National University of Juridical Sciences, India. At Harvard, I received the Irving Oberman Memorial Environmental Law Prize and the Abram Chayes International Public Service Fellowship. I have also received research and advocacy fellowships from the Canadian Social Sciences and Research Council, the American Society for Legal History, the American Society for Environmental History, the Berkman-Klein Center for Internet and Society, Harvard University\u2019s Office for Scholarly Communication, the Public International Law and Policy Group, the Center for International Environmental Law, Watson Institute for International Studies at Brown University. I have studied and worked in disaster management in central India, in the borderlands between India, Pakistan, and China, and in the Philippines. I have also trained and advised officials and civil society in India, Thailand, Canada, and at the United Nations. From 2006 to 2010, I was an associate with Radon & Ishizumi in New York and worked on pharmaceutical and biotechnology projects. During this time, I also advised public authorities and corporate clients on constitution development in Nepal and environmental policymaking in the Caucasus, respectively.

Harney Chair in Ethnic, Immigration and Pluralism Studies\r Professor of Law, Political Science & Global Affairs, and former Canada Research Chair in Citizenship and Multiculturalism Jackman Law Building78 Queen's ParkToronto, Ontario M5S 2C5 Ayelet Shachar (FRSC) is Professor of Law, Political Science, and Global Affairs, and the holder of the R.F. Harney Chair in Ethnic, Immigration and Pluralism Studies at the University of Toronto, where she directs the Harney Program at the Munk School of Global Affairs & Public Policy. Previously, she was a Scientific Member of the Max Planck Society\u2014one of the foremost research organizations in the world\u2014and Director at the Max Planck Institute for the Study of Religious and Ethnic Diversity. She was awarded the Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize in 2019. Before her recruitment to the Max Planck Society, she held the Canada Research Chair in Citizenship and Multiculturalism. At Goethe University Frankfurt she is affiliated with both the Faculty of Law and the Normative Orders Research Centre, where she is the leader of the \"Transformations of Citizenship\" research group. Shachar has published extensively on the topics of citizenship theory, immigration law, cultural diversity and women's rights, new border regimes, highly skilled migration and global inequality, and the marketization of citizenship. Her research is motivated by the need to develop new legal principles to address some of the most pressing issues of our time: how to live together in diverse societies, how to grant rights to those who lack formal access to membership, and how to tame the ever-expanding reach of borders and migration control in a world of persistent inequality.Shachar is the author of Multicultural Jurisdictions: Cultural Differences and Women's Rights (Cambridge University Press, 2001 & 2009), for which she won the American Political Science Association 2002 Foundations of Political Theory Section Best First Book Award. This work has inspired a new generation of thinking about how to best mitigate the tensions between gender equality and religious diversity. It has also proved influential in the real world, intervening in actual public policy and legislative debates. It has been cited by, among others, England's Archbishop of Canterbury (who described Shachar's work as \"highly original and significant\"), Ontario's Ministry of the Attorney General, and the Supreme Court of Canada. Over the last twenty years, Multicultural Jurisdictions has become a key reference point for feminist approaches to the study of law and religion.Shachar's work combines \"big ideas\" from law and political theory with innovative problem-solving and institutional design. The Birthright Lottery: Citizenship and Global Inequality (Harvard University Press, 2009) was named 2010 International Ethics Notable Book in recognition of its \"superior scholarship and contribution to the field of international ethics.\" It has created a groundswell of interest among policymakers and academics alike. Located at the intersection of law, economics, and political philosophy, The Birthright Lottery crafts new legal concepts and innovative institutional designs to promote global justice, with the aim of ameliorating the most glaring opportunity inequalities that attach to this system of allocation in today's world. This work has been the topic of special-issue symposiums, international workshops and roundtables, and the subject of essays that have appeared in professional and interdisciplinary publications, including the American Journal of Comparative Law, Ethics & International Affairs, Harvard Law Review, Issues in Legal Scholarship, La Revue Nouvelle, Political Theory, Rorotoko, Nexus, Edge, Tikkun, and the Literary Review of Canada.  Shachar is also the lead editor of the field-defining The Oxford Handbook of Citizenship (Oxford University Press, 2017 & 2020). This work has already emerged as a major reference work in the field for those engaged with citizenship from a philosophical, political, legal and cultural perspective. It has been described by Joseph Weiler as: \u201cThe definitive source on a critical concept in political and social life. Innovative in its conception and authoritative in its excitation.\u201d Pratap Mehta observes that \u201c[n]o other single volume achieves the theoretical acuity, historical depth, legal grounding, and sociological analysis of citizenship that this book manages to achieve. It is clear, wide ranging, and admirably un-parochial in the range of its references.\u201dShachar newest book, The Shifting Border: Legal Cartographies of Migration and Mobility (Critical Powers Series, Manchester University Press, 2020; shortlisted for the 2022 C.B. Macpherson Prize), critically examines the role of territory and new measures of managed migration control in selectively restricting - or, conversely, accelerating - mobility and access to the world\u2019s prosperous countries, as governments seek to regain control over a crucial realm of their allegedly waning sovereign authority. Here, as in her previous writings, Shachar not only reveals the deep currents that are reshaping the terrain of law and mobility, but also seeks to develop innovative legal responses to break the current deadlock as she seeks to refute the claim that applicable solutions are beyond reach or impossible to imagine. This work appears under the auspices of the Critical Powers Series, which is \u201cdedicated to constructing dialogues around innovative and original work in social and political theory\u201d.The Shifting Border has been described by Hiroshi Motomura as \u201ca remarkable book. Essential for understanding government responses to people on the move, Shachar\u2019s vivid description, analytical precision, and reasoned persuasion combine to challenge conventional wisdom about \u2018borders\u2019 and how they work. The result: exceptional insights into how migration control can be more just. The Shifting Border offers an indispensable roadmap to immigration and refugee debates all around the world\". A recent LSE book review opines: \"In her impressive book, The Shifting Border, Ayelet Shachar refuses to adhere to what she views as false dichotomies between traditional approaches to a concept (culture, citizenship, borders) and premature diagnoses of the concept\u2019s demise. The force of her argument is consistently oriented towards rethinking the question, offering a new framework to understanding the world. \u2026 Shachar\u2019s innovative framework nicely exemplifies the shift from idealized ethical debates to institutional and political analysis.\" \"Reading this essay by Shachar...is like getting the dream dinner invitation to hear cutting-edge thought on borders\" (CHOICE magazine).  Shachar is a global citizen at heart and the recipient of research excellence awards in four different countries (Canada, Israel, Germany, and the United States).

He is especially interested in what it means to have a fair opportunity to avoid crime and punishment. He has developed a distinctive interpretation of fair opportunity to avoid crime that helps explain, among other things, the moral significance at sentencing of whether a defendant came from an unfairly disadvantaged background or committed prior offenses.

She is a member of the Ontario and Illinois bars, Associate member, Garden Court Chambers, UK, sits on the boards of the UK-based Tax Justice Network and the steering committee of its global parent, the Global Alliance for Tax Justice, and specializes in tax, corporate, gender, international tax, property, and human rights law. Her current research revolves around three core questions: Until substantive equality of outcomes for all individuals can be attained, how can societies eliminate deeply- rooted structural inequalities and discriminatory practices? How can the power and wealth concentrated in global 'north' corporations and individuals through unequal property, political, tax, and budget laws be replaced with redistributive programs that maintain individual sustain\/abilities throughout life? And, what truths arise from Indigenous and diverse peoples' living knowledges and learnings about how to match rates of human innovation and development with the evolutionary rates of other members of the biosphere in order to increase the sustain\/abilities of all forms of life? She has pursued these questions while on numerous government commissions, while meeting with and advising governments, civil society, academic groups in Canada, across China and on every continent, as well as when working with the European Parliament, EU governments, the UN and other treaty bodies, international financial institutions, and with Indigenous, circumpolar Arctic, human rights, and diverse peoples' organizations, watching and learning how to expand current research and dissemination methods capable of addressing these increasingly urgent issues.

He brings a sociological perspective to bear on the issues raised by personal data processing in a database-dependent world. His surveillance interests include border and airport controls, social media, organizational routines, video camera surveillance, citizen registration and identification systems and social media. His concerns include, prominently, the social sorting capacities of contemporary surveillance, along with an exploration of their ethics and politics. From the mid-1980s, Lyon's broad concerns prompted a critical examination of the much-hyped \u2018microelectronics revolution\u2019 that gave way to the so-called \u2018information society.\u2019 In the 1990s, Lyon focused his analyses on the social origins, incidence and consequences of processing personal data, arguing that surveillance has become a major dimension of modernity in its own right. This aspect of his research has expanded considerably, especially since 9\/11, and involves extensive collaboration with colleagues and students. Surveillance is a globalized phenomenon, and Lyon's work focuses increasingly on the global south and on encouraging the development of Surveillance Studies networks around the world. From 2008-2010 David Lyon was a Canada Council Killam Research Fellow, investigating the current rise of national ID card systems in a cross-national comparative perspective. The work complements some of his other studies of surveillance and contributes to both empirical and theoretical understanding of contemporary smart, biometrics-based ID systems. Currently, Lyon is working towards a book entitled Surveillance: A Very Short Introduction and another on surveillance critique, The Eye of God. David Lyon and Surveillance Secularization While he is best known for his work in Surveillance Studies, David Lyon\u2019s research and writing span several other areas as well. Starting in Historical Sociology in the 1970s, his early work was on secularization processes \u2013 and the critique of some key theories -- in the modern world. Today, he tries to keep abreast of debates over the \"post-secular\" with an emphasis on the work of Charles Taylor. Following this, his main research directions explore other forms of social transformation that are both characteristic and constitutive of modernity. Research and Students As Director of the Surveillance Studies Centre, Lyon works with a multidisciplinary and international team on several related initiatives from primary research to theoretical development as well as associated media, policy and advocacy activities. The current team project is on \u201cBig Data Surveillance\u201d (2015-2020) and is funded by the SSHRC Partnership Grant program. It has streams on security, marketing and governance. This offers opportunities for a number of PhD students and postdoctoral fellows within Sociology. He continues to supervise and co-supervise PhDs. Recognition In 2020, Lyon received the Molson Prize, Canada Council for the Arts. In 2018, Lyon received the Surveillance Studies Network Outstanding Contribution Award. In 2017, Lyon received a Queen's University Award for Excellence in Graduate Supervision. In 2005, Lyon was awarded a Queen\u2019s Research Chair in Surveillance Studies. In 2007 Lyon received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the American Sociological Association Communication and Information Technology Section and in 2008 he was elected Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada. In 2012 he received an Outstanding Achievement Award from the Canadian Sociological Association, in 2015 an Insight-Impact Award from the SSHRC and in 2016 an honorary doctorate from the Universit\u00e0 della Svizzera Italiana in Switzerland. https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=9IlkVONwSbQ Publications Surveillance Big Data Surveillance and Security Intelligence (edited with David Murakami Wood) UBC Press 2020.

She completed her undergraduate degree at Queen\u2019s before earning postgraduate degrees in Economics (MA, PhD) at the University of British Columbia, later returning to Queen\u2019s to obtain her LLB. Following completion of her LL.B., she clerked at the Federal Court of Appeal and for former Justice Ian Binnie at the Supreme Court of Canada. She then completed her LLM at Yale on a Fulbright scholarship before joining the faculty. Professor Metcalf\u2019s research often draws on her graduate training in economics. She has used economic theory and empirical methods to study Indigenous rights, including the Supreme Court\u2019s s. 35 Aboriginal rights cases, considering impacts on governance, rights holders and resource industry participants. Another research strand relates to the role of law, especially constitutional rights, in influencing individuals\u2019 decisions, preferences and broader social norms. Professor Metcalf also studies issues in environmental and resource law more generally and her most recent work is focused on climate change. Her research has been published in journals including the Northwestern University Law Review, International Review of Law & Economics, Canadian Public Policy, University of Toronto Law Journal, Journal of Empirical Legal Studies, & Queen\u2019s Law Journal. Together with her co-author, Ian Keay, she was twice awarded the Vanderkamp prize for best paper in Canadian Public Policy. She frequently presents her work internationally at conferences and invited seminars. She has recently received grants from the Social Science & Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC) and the Canadian Foundation for Legal Research. She has been an invited visiting scholar at the University of Colorado Faculty of Law & Institute of Behavioral Sciences Institutions Program, and Vancouver School of Economics at UBC. Professor Metcalf\u2019s teaching at Queen\u2019s spans the areas of her research interests, and includes public law, constitutional law, law and economics, international environmental and resource law and (occasionally) property law. She has also coached the Queen\u2019s Laskin moot team, together with Queen\u2019s Law alumna Pam Hrick (LEAF). She served as Associate Dean Academic at the faculty from 2015-2018.

A critic of legal progressivism, social justice, and the discretionary administrative state, he has written on a range of pressing legal subjects at the front lines of the culture war inside the law, including environmental governance, climate change, energy policy, human rights and freedoms, professional and university governance, property and tort theory, free markets, and the rule of law. He has taught at law schools in Canada, the United States and New Zealand, practiced civil litigation at Borden Ladner Gervais LLP in Toronto, served as adjudicator and mediator on the Ontario Environmental Review Tribunal, and has published and commented widely in traditional and online media. He serves as senior fellow at the Fraser Institute, and helped to birth the Runnymede Society, a branch of the Canadian Constitution Foundation. He spearheaded resistance to and ultimate repeal of the Law Society of Ontario\u2019s statement of principles (SOP) policy that required Ontario lawyers to attest to their ideological purity to maintain their licence to practice. He is one of the co-creators of the Free North Declaration, a public petition and movement to protect civil liberties in Canada from COVID-19 irrationality and overreach.

Sypnowich has held teaching appointments at Oxford University, Leeds University, Leiden University, University of California (San Diego), and York University, before coming to Queen\u2019s. She has been awarded visiting fellowships at the Australian National University, Corpus Christi College, Oxford, and All Souls College, Oxford. She is also a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada. Christine Sypnowich\u2019s early work was in the philosophy of law, particularly the possibility of socialist legality given the Marxist antipathy to law. This was the subject of her first monograph published with OUP, a revised version of her Oxford dissertation. More recently her research has centred on egalitarianism, making the case for a human flourishing approach to equality in Equality Renewed: Justice, Human Flourishing and the Egalitarian Ideal (Routledge 2018). She has published over 60 essays as journal articles or book chapters. Her work has been translated into Chinese, Russian and Spanish and abridged versions published in accessible formats such as textbooks and popular philosophy. She is currently completing a book on the philosophy of G.A. Cohen for Polity Press. Active in the city of Kingston as an advocate for transparency at City Hall as well as heritage conservation, Sypnowich is also working on a monograph on the political philosophy of cultural heritage.

Zweibel, Professor and Co-Founding Director of the Legal Writing Academy at the University of Ottawa Faculty of Law. LL.M Tax Law (Denver University, 1981); J.D., cum laude (Booklyn Law School,1974) and B.A. English, cum laude ( SUNY at Stony Brook,1970). Professional training in conflict resolution, negotiation, mediation, dispute resolution systems design, and collaborative processes for public policy disputes includes courses at CDR Associates, (Boulder); CIIAN (Ottawa), and PON at Harvard (Boston). Everyone needs left and right brain activity. I exercise my left-brain teaching Introduction to Income Tax and my right-brain creating, organizing, and teaching the experiential learning-based Dispute Resolution and Professional Responsibility program for all first-year law students. The Legal Writing Academy occupies both my left and right brain continuously. Over thirty-five years I\u2019ve done a lot of stuff. You don\u2019t really want to read a list of my book chapters, articles, and presentations. So, I\u2019ll just pick some of teaching, research, and writing examples that are highlights for me and that tell you something about what makes me tick. Teaching - A few of my absolutely favourite things Take Tax-You Won\u2019t Regret It Tax is my absolute favourite course to teach. At some point, every aspect of law and public policy intersects with tax and tax policy. Students in my tax class pick up a new vocabulary, learn to read and apply complex statutory provisions, and to research and write about the tax aspects of a social-economic issue of their choice. I\u2019m working on an online version of intro tax that you can take at your own pace over the summer or as a month-long intensive. Zealous Advocates Use Dispute Resolution Processes to Get Their Clients the Best Outcomes Forget what popular culture says about lawyers as voracious litigators. Although I love a good TV court room drama, in reality, the experience of going to court might be exhilarating for lawyers, but never for clients. In your legal career you\u2019ll likely represent plaintiffs and defendants in many court actions, and you\u2019ll likely argue many preliminary motions, but mostly you\u2019ll achieve your client\u2019s objectives negotiating deals and settlements or working with a mediator to resolve disputes. And that\u2019s why my absolute favourite thing is designing the experiential learning activities for our first year Dispute Resolution and Professional Responsibility course where we introduce basic conflict analysis, interviewing, negotiation, and mediation advocacy skills along with professional responsibility and ethics. The DRPR course puts the substantive law you learn in other first-year courses into the context of real client problems and real ethical dilemmas. You\u2019ll interview clients, consider multiple approaches and solutions to client situations, choose among dispute resolution processes, negotiate and mediate agreements and disputes, practice oral advocacy in a non-litigation setting, and write a case analysis memo on a professional responsibility problem and a client advice letter. You\u2019ll become familiar with the Rules of Professional Conduct, grapple with ethical dilemmas, and consider what it takes to be culturally competent and to ensure access to justice. And, in keeping with the new reality of lawyer\u2019s work, you\u2019ll learn both in person and online skills. DRPR is my signature course. I introduced it over 25 years ago. The course is as real as we can make it. We train upper-year students as clients and each year over 50 legal practitioners participate as demonstrators and coaches for our capstone activity. And because the course always incorporated online learning strategies, when the Covid 19 shut down in-person courses, we had the know how to pivot to fully online course delivery. As a bonus for me, I\u2019ve used my dispute resolution skills to design and deliver courses to medical professionals and medical trainees on \u201craising conflict productively\u201d and negotiation. Great Lawyers are Great Writers \u2013 The Legal Writing Academy Now, my other absolute favourite thing is the Legal Writing Academy programing. Here\u2019s where I combine my passion for pedagogy with ensuring that UOttawa law graduates are confident and competent writers. The ability to write clearly, concisely, and persuasively is a core competence for every lawyer regardless of their career path. I take pride in our first-year workshops, DRPR writing modules, Civil Procedure memo module, Writing Leader\u2019s program, Dean\u2019s Fellows, Social Justice writing courses, and ten, upper-year Write with Purpose seminars. Students can meet with an upper-year Writing Leader to work on strategies to overcome writer\u2019s block and recognize, correct, and avoid typical writing problems. And our award-winning www.Pointfirstwriting.com website gives you just-in-time access to modules on writing legal memo and editing your own work. Experiential learning drives every component of the Legal Academy programming. We combine real life writing tasks with personalized and frequent feedback and mentoring, and presentations by practitioner experts. We emphasize student self-reflection, goal setting, and life-long learning strategies. We pilot new courses and new approaches to writing instruction. We\u2019ve run our first online summer course, Legal Memos Made Easy, designed for students to study at their own pace while working full time. Stay tuned for new initiatives. My Three Favourite Research Projects \u2013 Projects that Stretched my Brain Charitable Gifts of Conservation Easements: Lessons from the US Experience in Enhancing the Tax Incentive, Canadian Tax Journal (2010) vol. 58, no 1, 25 - 61 (co-author Karen Cooper). Researching the impact of the charitable tax credit on preserving eco-sensitive land let me delve into the science and economics of ecosystem services, climate change, environmental and behavioural economics. I learned a lot. A second branch of the project became a series of presentations that we thought had more punch than an academic article. What Sticks: How Medical Residents and Academic Health Care Faculty Transfer Conflict Resolution Training from the Workshop to the Workplace (Spring 2008) 3:25 Conflict Resolution Quarterly 321-350 (co-authors Goldstein, R, Manwaring, J. Marks, M.). Working with the faculty of medicine on training medical faculty and residents in raising conflict productively, led to an interdisciplinary study of what program participants actually took away and could apply in their work at the hospital and on research team. I learned new social science research techniques. The research had a double-back effect; we learned what worked and what we could change for greater impact. Legal Memos Made Easy and Edit Your Own Work on www.Pointfirstwriting.com These companion modules teach the practical skills of writing legal memos and a five-layered approach to editing. Each layer concentrates on a different task, keeping students and other users from being overwhelmed by fixing everything at once. Chunked sub-parts allow students to practice skills multiple times on a variety of documents and apply online feedback incrementally to drafts. The website is used in writing seminars and to support students writing assignments and major papers. Students can self-study anytime. And graduates tell us they return to the website in their first years of practice and share the site with colleagues at work. The website content and activities reflect years of studying how we learn and delving into online learning strategies. Teaching Awards \u2013 We don\u2019t teach or innovate for awards.

He is a specialist in comparative law and international humanitarian law, with research focusing on a variety of complex legal topics and current events that promote critical analysis and dialogue on the various relationships between law, religion and human rights. Through his research and teaching, as well as his deep knowledge of legal and political issues in Canadian foreign policy and international human rights, Professor Fathally has quickly become an internationally renowned expert. He is a recipient of the prestigious Van Calker Scholarship from the Swiss Institute of Comparative Law, the University of Ottawa\u2019s Gerald A. Beaudoin Scholarship and several other scholarships and grants. He is also an expert consultant to several international and intergovernmental organizations, including the World Health Organization , the World Justice Project and the Varieties of Democracy ( University of Oslo). Professor Fathally was a co-founder of JuriGlobe in 2007, oversaw the launching of the group\u2019s innovative and widely-used website in 2009, and serves as the group\u2019s current Executive Director and Senior Researcher. The JuriGlobe website \u2013 JuriGlobe World Legal Systems, www.juriglobe.ca \u2013 serves as an essential comparative legal tool, describing the legal systems in use around the world, the different official languages used in different jurisdictions, and the most important international commercial conventions at play in regions around the globe. In addition to becoming an educational tool for the teaching of comparative law and international law, and a key source of information for a number of international institutions and organizations, JuriGlobe work has drawn the attention of the legal scientific community in general, as evidenced by quotes and comments in various recent publications (e.g., in the American Journal of Comparative Law; Notarius, the scientific journal of the international Union of Notaries; and the Journal of UNESCO). As a professor of comparative law courses, specifically the world\u2019s dominant contemporary legal systems, Professor Fathally emphasizes the importance of dialogue between legal cultures by explaining to students the different correlations between the world\u2019s major legal traditions. He engages his students in a conversation-like manner and students are actively encouraged to raise questions. Within the University of Ottawa\u2019s unique law school, which offers both common law and civil law courses in both French and English, Professor Fathally works to bridge the gaps between Canada\u2019s two legal traditions by offering a course on civil law reasoning to students who have previously received training only in common law. In recognition of the quality of his teaching, Professor Fathally was awarded the prestigious Capital Educator\u2019s Award by the Ottawa Network for Education (ONE) in 2015 after being a finalist for the same award in 2014. This award celebrates the achievements of outstanding educators and commends public education in the Ottawa community. Candidates from the University of Ottawa are selected by a committee at the University\u2019s central administration on the basis of course evaluations completed by students. In the biography presented by the ONE upon awarding Professor Fathally the Capital Educator\u2019s Award, the organization called him \u201ca model of success for young people from immigrant backgrounds.\u201d Professor Fathally is frequently asked by Canadian and international media for his analysis of national and international issues related to the different armed conflicts in the Middle \u2013East, the interaction between systems of law and religion in the resolution of armed conflicts, the political changes recently experienced by certain Arab countries and the impact of these changes on women's rights, as well as countless other topics concerning the Arab-Muslim world and the legal implications of Canadian foreign policy in the Middle East. Drawing on his expertise in comparative law, Professor Fathally takes very seriously the need to educate the public on such topics, and he has been widely recognized for his efforts. In 2013, with a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 that then boasted over hundreds of national and international media appearances, Professor Fathally was awarded the University of Ottawa\u2019s Excellence in Media Relations Award, an impressive accomplishment given the University of Ottawa\u2019s reputation as a leader in Canadian University media hits. According to the selection committee, Professor Fathally ranked as the University\u2019s \u201cmost popular expert among the Canadian public\u201d and the committee noted that \u201che has become a model of excellence for his peers.\u201d This recognition led to him being hired in 2014 as a collaborator on the French-language program \u201cLes Voies du Retour\u201d mounted by Canada\u2019s French-language public broadcaster, Radio-Canada. In only a few short years as a professor, Jabeur Fathally has become one of Canada\u2019s go-to sources for understanding the specificities of Islamic law, and for bringing a knowledge of contemporary legal systems to the Canadian public. Following the political changes in various Arab countries after the Arab Spring in 2011, and at the insistence of Professor Fathally, the JuriGlobe group collaborated with the University of Ottawa\u2019s Human Rights Research and Education Centre (HRREC) in the creation of numerous workshops and conferences aimed at providing the Canadian public with a better understanding of the challenges posed by these changes and, more specifically, to draw the public\u2019s attention to the impact of these changes on women's rights in the region. Indeed, Professor Fathally was among the first Canadian intellectuals to draw attention to the specific challenges these policy changes posed for Arab women. His article \u201cLes droits des femmes \u00e0 l\u2019aube du printemps arabe : de \u00ab ne pas oublier les femmes \u00bb au \u00ab Femmes : n\u2019oubliez pas ! \u00bb\u201d [Translation: \u201cThe rights of women at the dawn of the Arab Spring: From \u2018do not forget the women\u2019 to \u2018Women: do not forget!\u2019\u201d, won the prestigious Paul Pinchaud award in 2013 for the best scholarly article published in the journal \u00c9tudes internationals, awarded by the Institute of International Studies of Laval University. In addition to the excellence of the text, the Committee stressed its originality and its timeliness. Jabeur Fathally is a member of the Faculty of graduate studies of the University of Ottawa and entitled to supervise Ph.D and Master thesis.","304":null,"305":"Margarida Garcia est professeure \u00e0 la Facult\u00e9 de droit, Section de droit civil.
