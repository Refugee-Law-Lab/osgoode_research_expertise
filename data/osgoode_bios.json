    "bio":"Professor Rabiat Akande works in the fields of legal history, law and religion, constitutional and comparative constitutional law, Islamic law, international law, and (post)colonial African law and society. Her research explores law\u2019s interplay with global inequality. She investigates this relationship in the historical setting of Europe\u2019s nineteenth and twentieth-century empire, especially in its encounter with Africa and the Muslim World. Her work further grapples with the afterlife of that encounter for law, unveiling legacies that resound far beyond erstwhile colonies. In her recent book, Entangled Domains: Empire, Law and Religion in Northern Nigeria (Cambridge University Press, 2023), Dr. Akande investigates the case of the British imperial encounter in Colonial Northern Nigeria. In particular, the book chronicles contestations between British colonial officials, Christian missionaries, and indigenous Muslim elites over law\u2019s governance religious difference, and grapples with the postcolonial legacy of those struggles. The book illuminates law\u2019s centrality to one of modernity\u2019s most contested issues\u2013the relationship between religion, the state, and society\u2013while also spotlighting law\u2019s complex relationship with power, political theology, identity, and socio-political change.

Dr. Akande is currently at work on \u201cMalcolm X, Black Globalism, and the Human Rights Critique of Imperialism,\u201d a book project that investigates the globalist critique of imperialism that was central to Malcolm X\u2019s thought in his last years and inspired by his visits to Africa and the Muslim World. She is also at work on a volume interrogating histories of the idea of the \u201cinternational\u201d in pre-colonial Africa.

I am also a research Fellow at the Dahdaleh Institute for Global Health Research at York University, and a Senior Fellow at Melbourne University Law School. My first book, All Is Well: Catastrophe and the Making of the Normal State was published by Oxford University Press in 2022. In All Is Well, I offer a history of the mutually constitutive relationship between disasters and states during the eighteenth-century and show the enduring influence of the underlying narratives, instincts, techniques, and practices on global disaster management today. I am currently working on two book projects. The first examines the history of war, environmental degradation\/disasters, and human displacement from 1860 to the present. This research is funded by a Social Sciences and Humanities Council Insight Development Grant and supported by Osgoode Hall Law School, York University\u2019s Center for Refugee Studies, and the Dahdaleh Institute for Global Health Research. The second book project presents a legal and environmental history of the relationship between the international environmentalism movement of the 1960s and 70s, and contemporary global crises of food insecurity and climate change. I have published in encyclopedias, edited volumes and in legal and interdisciplinary journals such as the University of British Columbia Law Review, the Fordham Environmental Law Review, Global Jurist, the Indian Journal of International Law, and the Journal of Intellectual Property Rights. I occasionally write essays and book reviews for public facing periodicals and websites and have developed several case studies for Harvard Law School\u2019s Case Studies Program. During 2016-2017, I was a Visiting Professor and Catalyst Fellow at Osgoode, and an adjunct faculty at Northeastern University School of Law.

    "bio":"As of July 2021, Professor Craig Scott is serving as the Associate Dean (Academic) of Osgoode. Professor Scott\u2019s teaching and research have been primarily in the fields of public international law and private international law, with a focus on the place of international human rights law in both of these fields. His most recent work draws on all three of these fields, including in the areas of human rights torts across borders, transnational corporate accountability and transitional justice. He has also written on constitutional rights protection in Canada and abroad. Much of his work has been on the theory and doctrine of economic, social and cultural rights. His work and teaching is strongly influenced by his interests in legal theory and in policy responses to globalization. He is series editor of Hart Monographs in Transnational and International Law, and is Founding Editor of Transnational Legal Theory. Professor Scott has sought to create productive linkages between his academic work and various external commitments, particularly engagement with civil society. On the Canadian scene, he was one of the drafters of the Alternative Social Charter put forward during the Charlottetown constitutional round. He has been closely involved in advising equality-seeking, notably anti-poverty, groups on Canadian Charter of Rights litigation and on preparing interventions before various UN human rights bodies on Canada\u2019s record of treaty compliance. He has been involved in appeals or interventions in the Supreme Court of Canada in major cases which have dealt with the interface of international law and Canadian law (Pushpanathan, Reference re Secession of Quebec, Baker). He advised in the formulation of the statement of claim in the civil lawsuit of Maher Arar against the Government of Canada and provided an expert report on Arar\u2019s travel security during the settlement process. Professor Scott was closely involved in the development of key aspects of the current South African constitution, beginning with his role advising the African National Congress on these matters while the ANC was still in exile. In 1993-1994, he served as co-counsel for the government of Bosnia in a case before the International Court of Justice, with responsibility for developing arguments on the limits of the powers of the UN Security Council. He has given academic opinions on international law to various governments and international organizations on issues related to such matters as the law of the sea, territorial claims and adjudicative procedures; he has also given opinions to non-governmental organizations and aboriginal government representatives on matters ranging from the legality of economic sanctions on Iraq to inland fisheries jurisdiction to transfer of environmental technology to counter global climate change. More recently, he was heavily involved with the London-based Sri Lanka Campaign for Peace and Justice and with the civil-society truth commission in Honduras known as the Comisi\u00f3n de Verdad, on which he served as a Commissioner. Professor Scott was a member of the Faculty of Law, University of Toronto, from 1989 to 2001. He joined Osgoode Hall Law School in 2000 following a term as a Jean Monnet Fellow at the European University Institute in Florence. From 2001 to 2004, he was Osgoode\u2019s inaugural Associate Dean (Research and Graduate Studies). During the 2010-2011 academic year, he was an Ikerbasque Fellow with the Basque Government\u2019s Foundation for Science, based in Bilbao at the Universidad de Deusto. He was Director of the Jack and Mae Nathanson Centre on Transnational Human Rights, Crime and Security from 2006 until the end of 2011. He served in 2020-21 as the Graduate Program Director for Osgoode\u2019s PhD and research-stream LLM programs. Prior to starting his academic career, Professor Scott served as law clerk to the former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Canada, Brian Dickson. He attended the Universities of Oxford and London on a Rhodes Scholarship. From March 2012 to October 2015, he served as Member of Parliament for Toronto-Danforth in Canada\u2019s House of Commons, and was the New Democratic Party\u2019s Official Opposition Critic for Democratic and Parliamentary Reform.
