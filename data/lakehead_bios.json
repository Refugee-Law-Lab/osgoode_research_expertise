Prior to that, he started two companies, worked in the financial services industry, and practiced civil and commercial litigation in Montreal.Phil graduated from the McGill Faculty of Law with degrees in civil and common law, on the Dean\u2019s Honor List and with the highest standing in property law and constitutional law. He subsequently pursued an LL.M. as a Bombardier scholar. Phil is called to the bar in New York, Massachusetts, and Quebec. He is a fellow of the Chartered Institute of Arbitrators and a Financial Planner, and he holds two securities designations.Phil has authored over 25 academic articles, most peer-reviewed. His research focuses on public law (principally employment and taxation law), behavioral economics, and new religious movements. Phil also writes on other things, such as Quebec\u2019s Bill 21, children\u2019s literature, and the porn industry. A free version of each of his articles can be accessed at https:\/\/ssrn.com\/author=2790633.Although he does wear the same outfit every day, Phil tries to spend some of his free time leaving his narrow comfort zone. He has traveled to 42 countries and run three marathons. Last summer, with one spare set of clothes, he walked 900 kilometers across Spain on the Camino de Santiago. That got him thinking it would make sense to ascend the Seven Summits. Phil is an avid collector of Scientology books and archival documents, many of which can be consulted during his office hours.Phil has also failed a lot.

Although the selection rate seems to hover around 75%, Phil wasn\u2019t selected as an editor of the McGill Law Journal. With four manuscripts, he spent almost two years trying to get his first publication. It would be another year before he published in a law review. Phil welcomes discussions about his failures, as he thinks law professors too often lack humility. (He even wrote an article on that: https:\/\/papers.ssrn.com\/sol3\/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3726628.)Over the past two years, Phil has given interviews to or briefed journalists from nine media outlets.
