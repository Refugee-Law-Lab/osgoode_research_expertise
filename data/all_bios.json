I am also a research Fellow at the Dahdaleh Institute for Global Health Research at York University, and a Senior Fellow at Melbourne University Law School. My first book, All Is Well: Catastrophe and the Making of the Normal State was published by Oxford University Press in 2022. In All Is Well, I offer a history of the mutually constitutive relationship between disasters and states during the eighteenth-century and show the enduring influence of the underlying narratives, instincts, techniques, and practices on global disaster management today. I am currently working on two book projects. The first examines the history of war, environmental degradation\/disasters, and human displacement from 1860 to the present. This research is funded by a Social Sciences and Humanities Council Insight Development Grant and supported by Osgoode Hall Law School, York University\u2019s Center for Refugee Studies, and the Dahdaleh Institute for Global Health Research. The second book project presents a legal and environmental history of the relationship between the international environmentalism movement of the 1960s and 70s, and contemporary global crises of food insecurity and climate change. I have published in encyclopedias, edited volumes and in legal and interdisciplinary journals such as the University of British Columbia Law Review, the Fordham Environmental Law Review, Global Jurist, the Indian Journal of International Law, and the Journal of Intellectual Property Rights. I occasionally write essays and book reviews for public facing periodicals and websites and have developed several case studies for Harvard Law School\u2019s Case Studies Program. During 2016-2017, I was a Visiting Professor and Catalyst Fellow at Osgoode, and an adjunct faculty at Northeastern University School of Law. I hold an SJD, an interdisciplinary doctorate from Harvard Law School, LLMs from Harvard Law School and American University\u2019s Washington College of Law, and a BA LLB (with honors) from the National University of Juridical Sciences, India.

He has done consultancy work on constitution-building for International IDEA and, prior to his graduate studies, he worked in litigation for the Quebec Department of Justice.B\u00e9dard-Rubin currently pursues two main research projects. The first is an intellectual history of the foundations of public law in French Canada. This project seeks to reconstruct the intellectual networks in which French Canadian public lawyers participated to excavate the transatlantic influences on the formation of Quebec\u2019s legal syncretism. This genealogical reconstruction recovers the conceptual and theoretical innovations that allowed French Canadians to articulate a genuine theory of the state outside of the revolutionary framework. In so doing, this work sheds a different, somewhat oblique light on Canada\u2019s constitutional experience and questions its status in comparative constitutional scholarship.The second research project investigates judicial bilingualism in Canada. Using mixed social science methods, this project explores the various empirical impacts of bilingualism on judicial behaviour, the normative significance of legal bilingualism for the authority of judicial decisions, and the ways in which language shapes the dominant conception of the judicial role in Canada\u2019s French and English public spheres.Jean-Christophe\u2019s work has been published in English and French in the Review of Constitutional Studies, the Canadian Journal of Law & Society, the Osgoode Hall Law Journal, the Bulletin d\u2019histoire politique, and the International Journal of Canadian Studies, amongst others.

Harney Chair in Ethnic, Immigration and Pluralism Studies\r Professor of Law, Political Science & Global Affairs, and former Canada Research Chair in Citizenship and Multiculturalism Jackman Law Building78 Queen's ParkToronto, Ontario M5S 2C5 Ayelet Shachar (FRSC) is Professor of Law, Political Science, and Global Affairs, and the holder of the R.F. Harney Chair in Ethnic, Immigration and Pluralism Studies at the University of Toronto, where she directs the Harney Program at the Munk School of Global Affairs & Public Policy. Previously, she was a Scientific Member of the Max Planck Society\u2014one of the foremost research organizations in the world\u2014and Director at the Max Planck Institute for the Study of Religious and Ethnic Diversity. She was awarded the Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize in 2019. Before her recruitment to the Max Planck Society, she held the Canada Research Chair in Citizenship and Multiculturalism. At Goethe University Frankfurt she is affiliated with both the Faculty of Law and the Normative Orders Research Centre, where she is the leader of the \"Transformations of Citizenship\" research group. Shachar has published extensively on the topics of citizenship theory, immigration law, cultural diversity and women's rights, new border regimes, highly skilled migration and global inequality, and the marketization of citizenship. Her research is motivated by the need to develop new legal principles to address some of the most pressing issues of our time: how to live together in diverse societies, how to grant rights to those who lack formal access to membership, and how to tame the ever-expanding reach of borders and migration control in a world of persistent inequality.Shachar is the author of Multicultural Jurisdictions: Cultural Differences and Women's Rights (Cambridge University Press, 2001 & 2009), for which she won the American Political Science Association 2002 Foundations of Political Theory Section Best First Book Award. This work has inspired a new generation of thinking about how to best mitigate the tensions between gender equality and religious diversity. It has also proved influential in the real world, intervening in actual public policy and legislative debates. It has been cited by, among others, England's Archbishop of Canterbury (who described Shachar's work as \"highly original and significant\"), Ontario's Ministry of the Attorney General, and the Supreme Court of Canada. Over the last twenty years, Multicultural Jurisdictions has become a key reference point for feminist approaches to the study of law and religion.Shachar's work combines \"big ideas\" from law and political theory with innovative problem-solving and institutional design. The Birthright Lottery: Citizenship and Global Inequality (Harvard University Press, 2009) was named 2010 International Ethics Notable Book in recognition of its \"superior scholarship and contribution to the field of international ethics.\" It has created a groundswell of interest among policymakers and academics alike. Located at the intersection of law, economics, and political philosophy, The Birthright Lottery crafts new legal concepts and innovative institutional designs to promote global justice, with the aim of ameliorating the most glaring opportunity inequalities that attach to this system of allocation in today's world. This work has been the topic of special-issue symposiums, international workshops and roundtables, and the subject of essays that have appeared in professional and interdisciplinary publications, including the American Journal of Comparative Law, Ethics & International Affairs, Harvard Law Review, Issues in Legal Scholarship, La Revue Nouvelle, Political Theory, Rorotoko, Nexus, Edge, Tikkun, and the Literary Review of Canada.  Shachar is also the lead editor of the field-defining The Oxford Handbook of Citizenship (Oxford University Press, 2017 & 2020). This work has already emerged as a major reference work in the field for those engaged with citizenship from a philosophical, political, legal and cultural perspective. It has been described by Joseph Weiler as: \u201cThe definitive source on a critical concept in political and social life. Innovative in its conception and authoritative in its excitation.\u201d Pratap Mehta observes that \u201c[n]o other single volume achieves the theoretical acuity, historical depth, legal grounding, and sociological analysis of citizenship that this book manages to achieve. It is clear, wide ranging, and admirably un-parochial in the range of its references.\u201dShachar newest book, The Shifting Border: Legal Cartographies of Migration and Mobility (Critical Powers Series, Manchester University Press, 2020; shortlisted for the 2022 C.B. Macpherson Prize), critically examines the role of territory and new measures of managed migration control in selectively restricting - or, conversely, accelerating - mobility and access to the world\u2019s prosperous countries, as governments seek to regain control over a crucial realm of their allegedly waning sovereign authority. Here, as in her previous writings, Shachar not only reveals the deep currents that are reshaping the terrain of law and mobility, but also seeks to develop innovative legal responses to break the current deadlock as she seeks to refute the claim that applicable solutions are beyond reach or impossible to imagine. This work appears under the auspices of the Critical Powers Series, which is \u201cdedicated to constructing dialogues around innovative and original work in social and political theory\u201d.The Shifting Border has been described by Hiroshi Motomura as \u201ca remarkable book. Essential for understanding government responses to people on the move, Shachar\u2019s vivid description, analytical precision, and reasoned persuasion combine to challenge conventional wisdom about \u2018borders\u2019 and how they work. The result: exceptional insights into how migration control can be more just. The Shifting Border offers an indispensable roadmap to immigration and refugee debates all around the world\". A recent LSE book review opines: \"In her impressive book, The Shifting Border, Ayelet Shachar refuses to adhere to what she views as false dichotomies between traditional approaches to a concept (culture, citizenship, borders) and premature diagnoses of the concept\u2019s demise. The force of her argument is consistently oriented towards rethinking the question, offering a new framework to understanding the world. \u2026 Shachar\u2019s innovative framework nicely exemplifies the shift from idealized ethical debates to institutional and political analysis.\" \"Reading this essay by Shachar...is like getting the dream dinner invitation to hear cutting-edge thought on borders\" (CHOICE magazine).  Shachar is a global citizen at heart and the recipient of research excellence awards in four different countries (Canada, Israel, Germany, and the United States). She has presented her work across the world and held visiting professorships in leading universities, including the Leah Kaplan Visiting Professor in Human Rights at Stanford Law School and the Jeremiah Smith Jr. Visiting Professor of Law at Harvard Law School.

This research also has significant practical implications for topical legal challenges faced by the aging workforce such as the duty to accommodate senior workers, mandatory retirement and cost-based defence claims. Her recent research projects expand to issues of diversity at work, intergenerational equity, and age & intersectionality. Alon-Shenker received the Dean\u2019s Scholarly, Research and Creative Activity Award in 2014 for her scholarly achievements. In 2016, she received the Provost's Experiential Teaching Award in recognition of her work to develop and lead the Ryerson Law & Business Clinic. Alon-Shenker was the Co-Editor-in-Chief of International Journal of Comparative Labour Law and Industrial Relations, external link, and is a member of the Labour Law Casebook Group co-editing the Labour and Employment Law: Cases, Material, and Commentary, external link (Irwin Law).

    "bio":"Beverley Baines is a Professor of Public and Constitutional Law with a passion for illuminating the legal strategies the patriarchal state deploys to deny women their right to equality which is guaranteed in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Her passion dates from her involvement as a feminist constitutional consultant, first to the Canadian Advisory Council on the Status of Women and then to the Ad Hoc Committee of Women on the Constitution during the Charter debates of 1980-1982. Professor Baines earned a BA Hons (Economics and Political Science) from McGill and a JD from Queen\u2019s, following which she articled with Trumpour and Kennedy in Kingston, joined Queen\u2019s Law as a faculty member, was admitted to the Law Society of Upper Canada, and served as Associate Dean in the Faculty of Law (1994-1997). Seconded twice to the Faculty of Arts and Science, she was Co-Coordinator of the Institute of Women\u2019s Studies (1991-1993) and Head of the Department of Gender Studies (2004-2011). Professor Baines co-edited two books on women and constitutional law: The Gender of Constitutional Jurisprudence (2005) and Feminist Constitutionalism: Global Perspectives (2012).

Previously she worked as a lawyer and researcher at the Indigenous Law Research Unit (University of Victoria Faculty of Law), and as a staff lawyer at West Coast Environmental Law. In both positions she provided legal support to Indigenous communities and organizations engaged in the revitalization of their own laws for application in contemporary contexts.

Research topics Indigenous Legal Methods; Indigenous Environmental Law and Ecological Governance; Select Topics of Anishinaabe Law (child well-being, human rights, criminal, torts, and the environment); Field School Courses in Indigenous Legal Traditions; and Indigenous Child Well-Being Research focus statement Indigenous peoples across Canada face serious challenges that require the application of law in its most healing forms to enable the necessary transformations towards a more just society. Indigenous peoples\u2019 own laws are an essential component of confronting these challenges encountered within and beyond their communities. Lindsay Borrows\u2019 work examines the different sources from which Indigenous laws flow including for example custom, deliberation, stories, songs, ceremony, dances, language, legislation, treaties (etc.). She also studies the methods people use to draw out law from these sources. Prof. Borrows is particularly interested in an emergent area of Indigenous legal research\u2014looking to the natural world as legal precedent and exploring how reading the land as a legal archive introduces innovative practices of deliberation, decision-making, and dispute-resolution.

He earned his PhD in Politics from Princeton University, his JD from Yale Law School, and his AB in Applied Mathematics-Economics from Brown University, where he graduated magna cum laude. At Princeton, Ewing was a Laurance S. Rockefeller Graduate Prize Fellow in the University Center for Human Values. While a law student at Yale, he was a Coker Fellow and, in the fall of 2009, a research assistant to Associate Justice Stephen Breyer of the Supreme Court of the United States. In his scholarship, Ewing analyzes the moral and political foundations of different forms of legal responsibility for wrongdoing, particularly criminal punishment. He is especially interested in what it means to have a fair opportunity to avoid crime and punishment. He has developed a distinctive interpretation of fair opportunity to avoid crime that helps explain, among other things, the moral significance at sentencing of whether a defendant came from an unfairly disadvantaged background or committed prior offenses.

She has pursued these questions while on numerous government commissions, while meeting with and advising governments, civil society, academic groups in Canada, across China and on every continent, as well as when working with the European Parliament, EU governments, the UN and other treaty bodies, international financial institutions, and with Indigenous, circumpolar Arctic, human rights, and diverse peoples' organizations, watching and learning how to expand current research and dissemination methods capable of addressing these increasingly urgent issues.

    "bio":"Research Areas Surveillance and Social Sorting; Big Data Surveillance; Identification Regimes; Privacy; Information Technologies; Christian Social Critique David Lyon's research, writing, and teaching interests revolve around major social transformations in the modern world. Questions of the information society, globalization, secularization, surveillance, and debates over \u201cpost-\u201d and \u201cdigital\u201d modernity feature prominently in his work. Lyon was formerly an editor of Surveillance & Society and is Associate Editor of The Information Society. He also serves on the international editorial boards of several other journals. His books have been translated into seventeen languages: Arabic, Chinese, Czech, Danish, Dutch, Farsi, German, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Spanish, Swedish and Turkish. Surveillance Surveillance Studies has been Lyon\u2019s major research area for the past 25 years. He brings a sociological perspective to bear on the issues raised by personal data processing in a database-dependent world. His surveillance interests include border and airport controls, social media, organizational routines, video camera surveillance, citizen registration and identification systems and social media. His concerns include, prominently, the social sorting capacities of contemporary surveillance, along with an exploration of their ethics and politics. From the mid-1980s, Lyon's broad concerns prompted a critical examination of the much-hyped \u2018microelectronics revolution\u2019 that gave way to the so-called \u2018information society.\u2019 In the 1990s, Lyon focused his analyses on the social origins, incidence and consequences of processing personal data, arguing that surveillance has become a major dimension of modernity in its own right. This aspect of his research has expanded considerably, especially since 9\/11, and involves extensive collaboration with colleagues and students. Surveillance is a globalized phenomenon, and Lyon's work focuses increasingly on the global south and on encouraging the development of Surveillance Studies networks around the world. From 2008-2010 David Lyon was a Canada Council Killam Research Fellow, investigating the current rise of national ID card systems in a cross-national comparative perspective. The work complements some of his other studies of surveillance and contributes to both empirical and theoretical understanding of contemporary smart, biometrics-based ID systems. Currently, Lyon is working towards a book entitled Surveillance: A Very Short Introduction and another on surveillance critique, The Eye of God. David Lyon and Surveillance Secularization While he is best known for his work in Surveillance Studies, David Lyon\u2019s research and writing span several other areas as well. Starting in Historical Sociology in the 1970s, his early work was on secularization processes \u2013 and the critique of some key theories -- in the modern world. Today, he tries to keep abreast of debates over the \"post-secular\" with an emphasis on the work of Charles Taylor. Following this, his main research directions explore other forms of social transformation that are both characteristic and constitutive of modernity. Research and Students As Director of the Surveillance Studies Centre, Lyon works with a multidisciplinary and international team on several related initiatives from primary research to theoretical development as well as associated media, policy and advocacy activities. The current team project is on \u201cBig Data Surveillance\u201d (2015-2020) and is funded by the SSHRC Partnership Grant program. It has streams on security, marketing and governance. This offers opportunities for a number of PhD students and postdoctoral fellows within Sociology. He continues to supervise and co-supervise PhDs. Recognition In 2020, Lyon received the Molson Prize, Canada Council for the Arts. In 2018, Lyon received the Surveillance Studies Network Outstanding Contribution Award. In 2017, Lyon received a Queen's University Award for Excellence in Graduate Supervision. In 2005, Lyon was awarded a Queen\u2019s Research Chair in Surveillance Studies. In 2007 Lyon received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the American Sociological Association Communication and Information Technology Section and in 2008 he was elected Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada. In 2012 he received an Outstanding Achievement Award from the Canadian Sociological Association, in 2015 an Insight-Impact Award from the SSHRC and in 2016 an honorary doctorate from the Universit\u00e0 della Svizzera Italiana in Switzerland. https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=9IlkVONwSbQ Publications Surveillance Big Data Surveillance and Security Intelligence (edited with David Murakami Wood) UBC Press 2020.

Following completion of her LL.B., she clerked at the Federal Court of Appeal and for former Justice Ian Binnie at the Supreme Court of Canada. She then completed her LLM at Yale on a Fulbright scholarship before joining the faculty. Professor Metcalf\u2019s research often draws on her graduate training in economics. She has used economic theory and empirical methods to study Indigenous rights, including the Supreme Court\u2019s s. 35 Aboriginal rights cases, considering impacts on governance, rights holders and resource industry participants. Another research strand relates to the role of law, especially constitutional rights, in influencing individuals\u2019 decisions, preferences and broader social norms. Professor Metcalf also studies issues in environmental and resource law more generally and her most recent work is focused on climate change. Her research has been published in journals including the Northwestern University Law Review, International Review of Law & Economics, Canadian Public Policy, University of Toronto Law Journal, Journal of Empirical Legal Studies, & Queen\u2019s Law Journal. Together with her co-author, Ian Keay, she was twice awarded the Vanderkamp prize for best paper in Canadian Public Policy. She frequently presents her work internationally at conferences and invited seminars. She has recently received grants from the Social Science & Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC) and the Canadian Foundation for Legal Research. She has been an invited visiting scholar at the University of Colorado Faculty of Law & Institute of Behavioral Sciences Institutions Program, and Vancouver School of Economics at UBC. Professor Metcalf\u2019s teaching at Queen\u2019s spans the areas of her research interests, and includes public law, constitutional law, law and economics, international environmental and resource law and (occasionally) property law.

Macpherson at the University of Toronto, where she completed her first two degrees before taking up a Commonwealth Scholarship to do a doctorate at Balliol College, Oxford. Sypnowich has held teaching appointments at Oxford University, Leeds University, Leiden University, University of California (San Diego), and York University, before coming to Queen\u2019s. She has been awarded visiting fellowships at the Australian National University, Corpus Christi College, Oxford, and All Souls College, Oxford. She is also a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada. Christine Sypnowich\u2019s early work was in the philosophy of law, particularly the possibility of socialist legality given the Marxist antipathy to law. This was the subject of her first monograph published with OUP, a revised version of her Oxford dissertation. More recently her research has centred on egalitarianism, making the case for a human flourishing approach to equality in Equality Renewed: Justice, Human Flourishing and the Egalitarian Ideal (Routledge 2018). She has published over 60 essays as journal articles or book chapters. Her work has been translated into Chinese, Russian and Spanish and abridged versions published in accessible formats such as textbooks and popular philosophy. She is currently completing a book on the philosophy of G.A. Cohen for Polity Press. Active in the city of Kingston as an advocate for transparency at City Hall as well as heritage conservation, Sypnowich is also working on a monograph on the political philosophy of cultural heritage.

Her articles have appeared in leading national and international law journals. She is the lead editor of a recent interdisciplinary special issue on the application of media and communication theory to the regulation of the networked information society.

He has taught Contract Law, Property Law, Administrative Law, and upper-year seminars in Commercial Law and Law and Religion.Phil previously served as an instructor at Carleton University's Department of Law and a law clerk at the Federal Court of Canada. Prior to that, he started two companies, worked in the financial services industry, and practiced civil and commercial litigation in Montreal.Phil graduated from the McGill Faculty of Law with degrees in civil and common law, on the Dean\u2019s Honor List and with the highest standing in property law and constitutional law. He subsequently pursued an LL.M. as a Bombardier scholar. Phil is called to the bar in New York, Massachusetts, and Quebec. He is a fellow of the Chartered Institute of Arbitrators and a Financial Planner, and he holds two securities designations.Phil has authored over 25 academic articles, most peer-reviewed. His research focuses on public law (principally employment and taxation law), behavioral economics, and new religious movements. Phil also writes on other things, such as Quebec\u2019s Bill 21, children\u2019s literature, and the porn industry. A free version of each of his articles can be accessed at https:\/\/ssrn.com\/author=2790633.Although he does wear the same outfit every day, Phil tries to spend some of his free time leaving his narrow comfort zone. He has traveled to 42 countries and run three marathons. Last summer, with one spare set of clothes, he walked 900 kilometers across Spain on the Camino de Santiago. That got him thinking it would make sense to ascend the Seven Summits. Phil is an avid collector of Scientology books and archival documents, many of which can be consulted during his office hours.Phil has also failed a lot. His first three grades in law school were B-s, and his final law school transcript lists two B-s and a C \u2014 the latter being a particularly unusual grade at McGill. Although the selection rate seems to hover around 75%, Phil wasn\u2019t selected as an editor of the McGill Law Journal. With four manuscripts, he spent almost two years trying to get his first publication. It would be another year before he published in a law review. Phil welcomes discussions about his failures, as he thinks law professors too often lack humility. (He even wrote an article on that: https:\/\/papers.ssrn.com\/sol3\/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3726628.)Over the past two years, Phil has given interviews to or briefed journalists from nine media outlets. He welcomes media inquiries in his areas of expertise.Bio (French):Phil Lord est professeur adjoint \u00e0 la Facult\u00e9 de droit Bora Laskin de l'Universit\u00e9 Lakehead. Il a enseign\u00e9 le droit des obligations, le droit des biens, le droit administratif et des cours avanc\u00e9s en droit et religion et en droit commercial.Phil \u00e9tait pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment charg\u00e9 de cours \u00e0 la Facult\u00e9 de droit de l'Universit\u00e9 Carleton et auxiliaire juridique \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale du Canada. Avant cela, il a fond\u00e9 deux entreprises, travaill\u00e9 dans le secteur des services financiers et pratiqu\u00e9 en litige civil et commercial \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al.Phil a obtenu ses dipl\u00f4mes en droit civil et en common law de la Facult\u00e9 de droit de l'Universit\u00e9 McGill. Il figure sur la liste d\u2019honneur du doyen et a re\u00e7u des prix pour avoir obtenu les meilleurs r\u00e9sultats en droit des biens et en droit constitutionnel. Il a par la suite obtenu son LL.M. comme boursier Bombardier. Phil est admis aux barreaux de New York, du Massachusetts et du Qu\u00e9bec. Il est aussi fellow du Chartered Institute of Arbitrators et Planificateur financier et il d\u00e9tient deux titres relatifs aux valeurs mobili\u00e8res.Phil est l'auteur de plus de 25 articles, la plupart avec comit\u00e9 de lecture. Sa recherche porte sur le droit public (principalement le droit de l'emploi et le droit fiscal), l'\u00e9conomie comportementale et les nouveaux mouvements religieux. Phil s'int\u00e9resse \u00e9galement \u00e0 d'autres sujets, comme la loi 21, les livres pour enfants et la pornographie. Une version gratuite de chacun de ses articles peut \u00eatre t\u00e9l\u00e9charg\u00e9e au https:\/\/ssrn.com\/author=2790633.M\u00eame s\u2019il s\u2019habille de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on chaque jour, Phil tente d\u2019investir une portion de son temps libre \u00e0 quitter sa zone de confort. Il a visit\u00e9 42 pays et couru trois marathons. L\u2019\u00e9t\u00e9 dernier, avec un seul ensemble de v\u00eatements de rechange, il a march\u00e9 900 kilom\u00e8tres \u00e0 travers l\u2019Espagne jusqu\u2019\u00e0 Saint-Jacques-de-Compostelle. C\u2019est l\u00e0 qu\u2019il a eu l\u2019id\u00e9e de d\u00e9buter l\u2019ascension des Sept sommets. Phil collectionne les livres et documents de la Scientologie, plusieurs desquels peuvent \u00eatre consult\u00e9s lors de ses heures de bureau.Le parcours de Phil comporte \u00e9galement de nombreux \u00e9checs. Ses trois premi\u00e8res notes \u00e0 McGill \u00e9taient des B- et son relev\u00e9 de notes final inclut deux B- et un C. Contrairement \u00e0 environ 75% des candidats, Phil n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 s\u00e9lectionn\u00e9 \u00e0 titre de r\u00e9dacteur de la Revue de droit de McGill. Arm\u00e9 de quatre textes, il a tent\u00e9 pendant pr\u00e8s de deux ans de publier son premier article scientifique. Il lui a fallu une ann\u00e9e de plus pour publier dans une revue de droit. Phil appr\u00e9cie \u00e9changer sur ses \u00e9checs, puisqu'il trouve que les professeurs de droit manquent trop souvent d'humilit\u00e9. (Il a m\u00eame \u00e9crit un article sur le sujet: https:\/\/papers.ssrn.com\/sol3\/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3726628.)Au cours des deux derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es, Phil a accord\u00e9 des entrevues ou des entretiens confidentiels \u00e0 des journalistes de neuf m\u00e9dias. Il est ouvert \u00e0 toute demande d'entrevue ou d'entretien.",
