    "bio":"Professor Patricia McMahon\u2019s areas of teaching and research are civil procedure, law and equity and legal history broadly defined. She is also the Director and Lead Interviewer of the Oral History Program at the Osgoode Society for Canadian Legal History and the Co-Academic Director of the Winkler Institute for Dispute Resolution. She joined the faculty in July 2022 after a number of years in private practice. Professor McMahon holds a BA in history from Huron University College at Western University and an MA in history from the University of Toronto. She was awarded a SSHRC Doctoral Fellowship for her work on how protest movements influenced Canada\u2019s nuclear policy from 1957 to 1963, the subject of her PhD in Canadian diplomatic and political history from the University of Toronto. This was followed by an LLB (with honours) from the University of Toronto, where she served as co-editor-in-chief of the University of Toronto Faculty of Law Review and received the Dean Cecil A. Wright Key. Following a clerkship with the Honorable Justice Ian Binnie at the Supreme Court of Canada, she attended Yale Law School as a Fulbright Fellow, where she completed an LLM and JSD. Her dissertation dealt with the influence of law reform movements on the procedural fusion of law and equity in Victorian England, which led to the Judicature Acts and modern conceptions of civil procedure. At Yale, she was also a student director in a clinic engaged in civil liberties litigation related to the policies of the U.S. government following the attacks of September 11, 2001. This included cases involving detentions, search and seizure, due process, international human rights and humanitarian law. From 2004 to 2008, she served as a regional representative for the executive committee of Yale Law School. While in private practice, Professor McMahon focused on complex litigation, including class actions, public law and tax litigation. She appeared before all levels of court, including the Supreme Court of Canada. Professor McMahon has published widely in her fields of study, including two books. The Persons Case: The Origins and Legacy of the Fight for Legal Personhood (with Robert J. Sharpe) was published jointly by the University of Toronto Press and Osgoode Society for Canadian Legal History in 2007. The book was the members\u2019 selection for that year, won the Canadian Law and Society Association Book Prize and was short-listed for the John Wesley Dafoe Book Prize. Essence of Indecision: Diefenbaker\u2019s Nuclear Policy 1957-1963 was published by McGill-Queen\u2019s University Press in 2009 and is considered the leading text on the topic. In addition, Professor McMahon has published widely on aspects of legal history, access to information, the fusion of law and equity and equitable procedure. She is currently working on two manuscripts: one related to the history of the fusion of law and equity and another with co-author Robert Bothwell on a multi-million-dollar fraud that involved the Canadian company that supplied uranium to the Manhattan Project during the Second World War. Professor McMahon\u2019s work with the Osgoode Society involves overseeing the oral history collection, which is the largest collection of its kind in the world. She is also the lead interviewer and regularly conducts interviews with lawyers and judges about their contributions to the legal profession. Research Interests: civil procedure; legal process; the impact of COVID-19 on the courts and the legal profession; lawyers in public life; law reform (both modern and historical); the fusion of law and equity; equitable procedure; and legal history broadly defined, including legal biography. Graduate Research Supervision (LLM): Professor McMahon\u2019s interests lie in the field of legal history, particularly Canadian and British legal history, private law topics involving equity, as well as civil procedure and legal process. Her recent work deals with the fusion of law and equity, law reform in historical context, and legal biography, including oral history. Professor McMahon is willing to read preliminary proposals from strong students in the areas of interest listed, and comment on interest in supervision prior to submission of an official application."

She served for 16 years as a Director and Trustee of the Institute for Research on Public Policy, and she was a member of the founding taskforce of the Ontario Justice Education Network. She is a past Director of the Toronto City Mission, a former Governor of the Shaw Festival and a recently retired Trustee of the Royal Ontario Museum.

Under Marilyn Pilkington\u2019s leadership as Dean, Osgoode Hall Law School restructured in response to significant government funding cuts. Enrolment in the LLB program was reduced to facilitate improvements to the program, and significant new initiatives and enrolments were developed at the graduate level, including the Osgoode Professional Development program for practising lawyers. The OPD is a unique program responding to the need for advanced and specialist education beyond the JD and, in addition to a range of continuing legal education programs, offers part-time LLM programs in more than fifteen specialist fields. During her deanship, substantial external funding was attracted to the Law School to support program development, facilities renewal, bursaries and new research initiatives. Despite the deep financial cuts, no deficits were incurred and the academic budget was significantly expanded. This strategic development of the law school emerged from the prior work of the Special Committee on Academic Planning, which Professor Pilkington had chaired."

He has represented countless numbers of people suffering from AIDS, cancer and multiple sclerosis who were charged after using marijuana for medicinal purposes, and as a result of these cases, the Federal Government was compelled to create a regulatory program authorizing the use of medical marijuana. In addition to his work in the area of consensual crime, Professor Young has also provided free legal services to victims of violent crime and to individuals attempting to sue the government for malicious prosecution. Canadian Lawyer magazine has recognized the contributions Professor Young has made to the law, and named him one of the \u201cTop 25 Most Influential\u201d in the justice system and legal profession in 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2014.

He has done consultancy work on constitution-building for International IDEA and, prior to his graduate studies, he worked in litigation for the Quebec Department of Justice.B\u00e9dard-Rubin currently pursues two main research projects. The first is an intellectual history of the foundations of public law in French Canada. This project seeks to reconstruct the intellectual networks in which French Canadian public lawyers participated to excavate the transatlantic influences on the formation of Quebec\u2019s legal syncretism. This genealogical reconstruction recovers the conceptual and theoretical innovations that allowed French Canadians to articulate a genuine theory of the state outside of the revolutionary framework. In so doing, this work sheds a different, somewhat oblique light on Canada\u2019s constitutional experience and questions its status in comparative constitutional scholarship.The second research project investigates judicial bilingualism in Canada. Using mixed social science methods, this project explores the various empirical impacts of bilingualism on judicial behaviour, the normative significance of legal bilingualism for the authority of judicial decisions, and the ways in which language shapes the dominant conception of the judicial role in Canada\u2019s French and English public spheres.Jean-Christophe\u2019s work has been published in English and French in the Review of Constitutional Studies, the Canadian Journal of Law & Society, the Osgoode Hall Law Journal, the Bulletin d\u2019histoire politique, and the International Journal of Canadian Studies, amongst others.

Harney Chair in Ethnic, Immigration and Pluralism Studies\r Professor of Law, Political Science & Global Affairs, and former Canada Research Chair in Citizenship and Multiculturalism Jackman Law Building78 Queen's ParkToronto, Ontario M5S 2C5 Ayelet Shachar (FRSC) is Professor of Law, Political Science, and Global Affairs, and the holder of the R.F. Harney Chair in Ethnic, Immigration and Pluralism Studies at the University of Toronto, where she directs the Harney Program at the Munk School of Global Affairs & Public Policy. Previously, she was a Scientific Member of the Max Planck Society\u2014one of the foremost research organizations in the world\u2014and Director at the Max Planck Institute for the Study of Religious and Ethnic Diversity. She was awarded the Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize in 2019. Before her recruitment to the Max Planck Society, she held the Canada Research Chair in Citizenship and Multiculturalism. At Goethe University Frankfurt she is affiliated with both the Faculty of Law and the Normative Orders Research Centre, where she is the leader of the \"Transformations of Citizenship\" research group. Shachar has published extensively on the topics of citizenship theory, immigration law, cultural diversity and women's rights, new border regimes, highly skilled migration and global inequality, and the marketization of citizenship. Her research is motivated by the need to develop new legal principles to address some of the most pressing issues of our time: how to live together in diverse societies, how to grant rights to those who lack formal access to membership, and how to tame the ever-expanding reach of borders and migration control in a world of persistent inequality.Shachar is the author of Multicultural Jurisdictions: Cultural Differences and Women's Rights (Cambridge University Press, 2001 & 2009), for which she won the American Political Science Association 2002 Foundations of Political Theory Section Best First Book Award. This work has inspired a new generation of thinking about how to best mitigate the tensions between gender equality and religious diversity. It has also proved influential in the real world, intervening in actual public policy and legislative debates. It has been cited by, among others, England's Archbishop of Canterbury (who described Shachar's work as \"highly original and significant\"), Ontario's Ministry of the Attorney General, and the Supreme Court of Canada. Over the last twenty years, Multicultural Jurisdictions has become a key reference point for feminist approaches to the study of law and religion.Shachar's work combines \"big ideas\" from law and political theory with innovative problem-solving and institutional design. The Birthright Lottery: Citizenship and Global Inequality (Harvard University Press, 2009) was named 2010 International Ethics Notable Book in recognition of its \"superior scholarship and contribution to the field of international ethics.\" It has created a groundswell of interest among policymakers and academics alike. Located at the intersection of law, economics, and political philosophy, The Birthright Lottery crafts new legal concepts and innovative institutional designs to promote global justice, with the aim of ameliorating the most glaring opportunity inequalities that attach to this system of allocation in today's world. This work has been the topic of special-issue symposiums, international workshops and roundtables, and the subject of essays that have appeared in professional and interdisciplinary publications, including the American Journal of Comparative Law, Ethics & International Affairs, Harvard Law Review, Issues in Legal Scholarship, La Revue Nouvelle, Political Theory, Rorotoko, Nexus, Edge, Tikkun, and the Literary Review of Canada.  Shachar is also the lead editor of the field-defining The Oxford Handbook of Citizenship (Oxford University Press, 2017 & 2020). This work has already emerged as a major reference work in the field for those engaged with citizenship from a philosophical, political, legal and cultural perspective. It has been described by Joseph Weiler as: \u201cThe definitive source on a critical concept in political and social life. Innovative in its conception and authoritative in its excitation.\u201d Pratap Mehta observes that \u201c[n]o other single volume achieves the theoretical acuity, historical depth, legal grounding, and sociological analysis of citizenship that this book manages to achieve. It is clear, wide ranging, and admirably un-parochial in the range of its references.\u201dShachar newest book, The Shifting Border: Legal Cartographies of Migration and Mobility (Critical Powers Series, Manchester University Press, 2020; shortlisted for the 2022 C.B. Macpherson Prize), critically examines the role of territory and new measures of managed migration control in selectively restricting - or, conversely, accelerating - mobility and access to the world\u2019s prosperous countries, as governments seek to regain control over a crucial realm of their allegedly waning sovereign authority. Here, as in her previous writings, Shachar not only reveals the deep currents that are reshaping the terrain of law and mobility, but also seeks to develop innovative legal responses to break the current deadlock as she seeks to refute the claim that applicable solutions are beyond reach or impossible to imagine. This work appears under the auspices of the Critical Powers Series, which is \u201cdedicated to constructing dialogues around innovative and original work in social and political theory\u201d.The Shifting Border has been described by Hiroshi Motomura as \u201ca remarkable book. Essential for understanding government responses to people on the move, Shachar\u2019s vivid description, analytical precision, and reasoned persuasion combine to challenge conventional wisdom about \u2018borders\u2019 and how they work. The result: exceptional insights into how migration control can be more just. The Shifting Border offers an indispensable roadmap to immigration and refugee debates all around the world\". A recent LSE book review opines: \"In her impressive book, The Shifting Border, Ayelet Shachar refuses to adhere to what she views as false dichotomies between traditional approaches to a concept (culture, citizenship, borders) and premature diagnoses of the concept\u2019s demise. The force of her argument is consistently oriented towards rethinking the question, offering a new framework to understanding the world. \u2026 Shachar\u2019s innovative framework nicely exemplifies the shift from idealized ethical debates to institutional and political analysis.\" \"Reading this essay by Shachar...is like getting the dream dinner invitation to hear cutting-edge thought on borders\" (CHOICE magazine).  Shachar is a global citizen at heart and the recipient of research excellence awards in four different countries (Canada, Israel, Germany, and the United States). She has presented her work across the world and held visiting professorships in leading universities, including the Leah Kaplan Visiting Professor in Human Rights at Stanford Law School and the Jeremiah Smith Jr. Visiting Professor of Law at Harvard Law School.

Shachar earned her LL.B in law and B.A. in political science, summa cum laude, from Tel Aviv University; LL.M. and J.S.D, both from Yale Law School. Before arriving at Yale, she was law clerk to Chief Justice Aharon Barak of the Supreme Court of Israel. She sits on the editorial boards of major peer-reviewed journals and book series in her field, and has delivered countless talks on her research in a range of academic, policy, and popular venues across the globe. In 2014, she was elected Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada. In 2015, she became Director of the Max Planck Institute for the Study of Religious and Ethnic Diversity.
