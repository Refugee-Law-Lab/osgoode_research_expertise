Previously she worked as a lawyer and researcher at the Indigenous Law Research Unit (University of Victoria Faculty of Law), and as a staff lawyer at West Coast Environmental Law. In both positions she provided legal support to Indigenous communities and organizations engaged in the revitalization of their own laws for application in contemporary contexts. She has worked on community-engaged projects with different legal traditions including Anishinaabe, Denezhu, Hai\u0301\u026bzaqv, Nlaka\u2019pamux, nuuc\u030caan\u0313u\u0142, St\u2019\u00e1t\u2019imc, Syilx and Tsilhqot\u2019in.

Her book Otter\u2019s Journey Through Indigenous Language and Law (UBC Press, 2018) explores the connections between language and law. Lindsay is Anishinaabe and a member of the Chippewas of Nawash First Nation. Research topics Indigenous Legal Methods; Indigenous Environmental Law and Ecological Governance; Select Topics of Anishinaabe Law (child well-being, human rights, criminal, torts, and the environment); Field School Courses in Indigenous Legal Traditions; and Indigenous Child Well-Being Research focus statement Indigenous peoples across Canada face serious challenges that require the application of law in its most healing forms to enable the necessary transformations towards a more just society. Indigenous peoples\u2019 own laws are an essential component of confronting these challenges encountered within and beyond their communities. Lindsay Borrows\u2019 work examines the different sources from which Indigenous laws flow including for example custom, deliberation, stories, songs, ceremony, dances, language, legislation, treaties (etc.). She also studies the methods people use to draw out law from these sources. Prof. Borrows is particularly interested in an emergent area of Indigenous legal research\u2014looking to the natural world as legal precedent and exploring how reading the land as a legal archive introduces innovative practices of deliberation, decision-making, and dispute-resolution.

Her current research revolves around three core questions: Until substantive equality of outcomes for all individuals can be attained, how can societies eliminate deeply- rooted structural inequalities and discriminatory practices? How can the power and wealth concentrated in global 'north' corporations and individuals through unequal property, political, tax, and budget laws be replaced with redistributive programs that maintain individual sustain\/abilities throughout life? And, what truths arise from Indigenous and diverse peoples' living knowledges and learnings about how to match rates of human innovation and development with the evolutionary rates of other members of the biosphere in order to increase the sustain\/abilities of all forms of life? She has pursued these questions while on numerous government commissions, while meeting with and advising governments, civil society, academic groups in Canada, across China and on every continent, as well as when working with the European Parliament, EU governments, the UN and other treaty bodies, international financial institutions, and with Indigenous, circumpolar Arctic, human rights, and diverse peoples' organizations, watching and learning how to expand current research and dissemination methods capable of addressing these increasingly urgent issues.

    "bio":"Research Areas Surveillance and Social Sorting; Big Data Surveillance; Identification Regimes; Privacy; Information Technologies; Christian Social Critique David Lyon's research, writing, and teaching interests revolve around major social transformations in the modern world. Questions of the information society, globalization, secularization, surveillance, and debates over \u201cpost-\u201d and \u201cdigital\u201d modernity feature prominently in his work. Lyon was formerly an editor of Surveillance & Society and is Associate Editor of The Information Society. He also serves on the international editorial boards of several other journals. His books have been translated into seventeen languages: Arabic, Chinese, Czech, Danish, Dutch, Farsi, German, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Spanish, Swedish and Turkish. Surveillance Surveillance Studies has been Lyon\u2019s major research area for the past 25 years. He brings a sociological perspective to bear on the issues raised by personal data processing in a database-dependent world. His surveillance interests include border and airport controls, social media, organizational routines, video camera surveillance, citizen registration and identification systems and social media. His concerns include, prominently, the social sorting capacities of contemporary surveillance, along with an exploration of their ethics and politics. From the mid-1980s, Lyon's broad concerns prompted a critical examination of the much-hyped \u2018microelectronics revolution\u2019 that gave way to the so-called \u2018information society.\u2019 In the 1990s, Lyon focused his analyses on the social origins, incidence and consequences of processing personal data, arguing that surveillance has become a major dimension of modernity in its own right. This aspect of his research has expanded considerably, especially since 9\/11, and involves extensive collaboration with colleagues and students. Surveillance is a globalized phenomenon, and Lyon's work focuses increasingly on the global south and on encouraging the development of Surveillance Studies networks around the world. From 2008-2010 David Lyon was a Canada Council Killam Research Fellow, investigating the current rise of national ID card systems in a cross-national comparative perspective. The work complements some of his other studies of surveillance and contributes to both empirical and theoretical understanding of contemporary smart, biometrics-based ID systems. Currently, Lyon is working towards a book entitled Surveillance: A Very Short Introduction and another on surveillance critique, The Eye of God. David Lyon and Surveillance Secularization While he is best known for his work in Surveillance Studies, David Lyon\u2019s research and writing span several other areas as well. Starting in Historical Sociology in the 1970s, his early work was on secularization processes \u2013 and the critique of some key theories -- in the modern world. Today, he tries to keep abreast of debates over the \"post-secular\" with an emphasis on the work of Charles Taylor. Following this, his main research directions explore other forms of social transformation that are both characteristic and constitutive of modernity. Research and Students As Director of the Surveillance Studies Centre, Lyon works with a multidisciplinary and international team on several related initiatives from primary research to theoretical development as well as associated media, policy and advocacy activities. The current team project is on \u201cBig Data Surveillance\u201d (2015-2020) and is funded by the SSHRC Partnership Grant program. It has streams on security, marketing and governance. This offers opportunities for a number of PhD students and postdoctoral fellows within Sociology. He continues to supervise and co-supervise PhDs. Recognition In 2020, Lyon received the Molson Prize, Canada Council for the Arts. In 2018, Lyon received the Surveillance Studies Network Outstanding Contribution Award. In 2017, Lyon received a Queen's University Award for Excellence in Graduate Supervision. In 2005, Lyon was awarded a Queen\u2019s Research Chair in Surveillance Studies. In 2007 Lyon received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the American Sociological Association Communication and Information Technology Section and in 2008 he was elected Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada. In 2012 he received an Outstanding Achievement Award from the Canadian Sociological Association, in 2015 an Insight-Impact Award from the SSHRC and in 2016 an honorary doctorate from the Universit\u00e0 della Svizzera Italiana in Switzerland. https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=9IlkVONwSbQ Publications Surveillance Big Data Surveillance and Security Intelligence (edited with David Murakami Wood) UBC Press 2020.

She completed her undergraduate degree at Queen\u2019s before earning postgraduate degrees in Economics (MA, PhD) at the University of British Columbia, later returning to Queen\u2019s to obtain her LLB. Following completion of her LL.B., she clerked at the Federal Court of Appeal and for former Justice Ian Binnie at the Supreme Court of Canada. She then completed her LLM at Yale on a Fulbright scholarship before joining the faculty. Professor Metcalf\u2019s research often draws on her graduate training in economics. She has used economic theory and empirical methods to study Indigenous rights, including the Supreme Court\u2019s s. 35 Aboriginal rights cases, considering impacts on governance, rights holders and resource industry participants. Another research strand relates to the role of law, especially constitutional rights, in influencing individuals\u2019 decisions, preferences and broader social norms. Professor Metcalf also studies issues in environmental and resource law more generally and her most recent work is focused on climate change. Her research has been published in journals including the Northwestern University Law Review, International Review of Law & Economics, Canadian Public Policy, University of Toronto Law Journal, Journal of Empirical Legal Studies, & Queen\u2019s Law Journal. Together with her co-author, Ian Keay, she was twice awarded the Vanderkamp prize for best paper in Canadian Public Policy. She frequently presents her work internationally at conferences and invited seminars. She has recently received grants from the Social Science & Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC) and the Canadian Foundation for Legal Research. She has been an invited visiting scholar at the University of Colorado Faculty of Law & Institute of Behavioral Sciences Institutions Program, and Vancouver School of Economics at UBC. Professor Metcalf\u2019s teaching at Queen\u2019s spans the areas of her research interests, and includes public law, constitutional law, law and economics, international environmental and resource law and (occasionally) property law. She has also coached the Queen\u2019s Laskin moot team, together with Queen\u2019s Law alumna Pam Hrick (LEAF). She served as Associate Dean Academic at the faculty from 2015-2018.

He has taught at law schools in Canada, the United States and New Zealand, practiced civil litigation at Borden Ladner Gervais LLP in Toronto, served as adjudicator and mediator on the Ontario Environmental Review Tribunal, and has published and commented widely in traditional and online media. He serves as senior fellow at the Fraser Institute, and helped to birth the Runnymede Society, a branch of the Canadian Constitution Foundation. He spearheaded resistance to and ultimate repeal of the Law Society of Ontario\u2019s statement of principles (SOP) policy that required Ontario lawyers to attest to their ideological purity to maintain their licence to practice.

Macpherson at the University of Toronto, where she completed her first two degrees before taking up a Commonwealth Scholarship to do a doctorate at Balliol College, Oxford. Sypnowich has held teaching appointments at Oxford University, Leeds University, Leiden University, University of California (San Diego), and York University, before coming to Queen\u2019s. She has been awarded visiting fellowships at the Australian National University, Corpus Christi College, Oxford, and All Souls College, Oxford. She is also a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada. Christine Sypnowich\u2019s early work was in the philosophy of law, particularly the possibility of socialist legality given the Marxist antipathy to law. This was the subject of her first monograph published with OUP, a revised version of her Oxford dissertation. More recently her research has centred on egalitarianism, making the case for a human flourishing approach to equality in Equality Renewed: Justice, Human Flourishing and the Egalitarian Ideal (Routledge 2018). She has published over 60 essays as journal articles or book chapters. Her work has been translated into Chinese, Russian and Spanish and abridged versions published in accessible formats such as textbooks and popular philosophy. She is currently completing a book on the philosophy of G.A. Cohen for Polity Press. Active in the city of Kingston as an advocate for transparency at City Hall as well as heritage conservation, Sypnowich is also working on a monograph on the political philosophy of cultural heritage.

    "bio":"Robert Yalden is the inaugural holder of the Stephen Sigurdson Professorship in Corporate Law and Finance. Prior to joining Queen\u2019s Law in 2018, Robert was a senior partner with Osler, Hoskin & Harcourt LLP and an Adjunct Professor with McGill Law. Robert\u2019s publications and teaching span 30 years. He has focused particularly on the forces that shape competing perspectives (both domestically and internationally) on the roles and responsibilities of corporations, boards of directors and different stakeholders, and that in turn influence the institutional structures that countries put in place to oversee and foster the evolution of business law. After clerking for Justice Bertha Wilson at the Supreme Court of Canada (1989-90), Robert was called to the Bar in Ontario (1991) and Quebec (1992). He joined Osler\u2019s Toronto office in 1993, became a partner in 1998, and was part of the team that opened Osler\u2019s Montreal office in 2001. Fluently bilingual, he served as a member of Osler's Executive Committee, as Co-Chair of Osler\u2019s National Mergers and Acquisitions Group for over a decade and as the head of the Corporate Department in Osler\u2019s Montreal office. Repeatedly recognized as one of Canada\u2019s leading business lawyers during his 25 years in practice, Robert worked closely with senior management teams and boards of directors in shaping some of Canada\u2019s most innovative and ground-breaking transactions.
