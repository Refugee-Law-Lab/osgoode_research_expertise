In Winter 2020, Professor Kianieff will be teaching a new course that he has developed in Blockchain Technologies and Commercial Law.\u00a0 The course, one of the first of its kind, will expose students to many of the legal and consumer protection issues that surround the development of distributed ledgers and their commercial applications.\u00a0 View\u00a0Muharem Kianieff's CV.
