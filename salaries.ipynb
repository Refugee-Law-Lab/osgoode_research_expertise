      "I am an Associate Professor at Osgoode Hall Law School. I am also a research Fellow at the Dahdaleh Institute for Global Health Research at York University, and a Senior Fellow at Melbourne University Law School. My first book, All Is Well: Catastrophe and the Making of the Normal State was published by Oxford University Press in 2022. In All Is Well, I offer a history of the mutually constitutive relationship between disasters and states during the eighteenth-century and show the enduring influence of the underlying narratives, instincts, techniques, and practices on global disaster management today. I am currently working on two book projects. The first examines the history of war, environmental degradation/disasters, and human displacement from 1860 to the present. This research is funded by a Social Sciences and Humanities Council Insight Development Grant and supported by Osgoode Hall Law School, York University’s Center for Refugee Studies, and the Dahdaleh Institute for Global Health Research. The second book project presents a legal and environmental history of the relationship between the international environmentalism movement of the 1960s and 70s, and contemporary global crises of food insecurity and climate change. I have published in encyclopedias, edited volumes and in legal and interdisciplinary journals such as the University of British Columbia Law Review, the Fordham Environmental Law Review, Global Jurist, the Indian Journal of International Law, and the Journal of Intellectual Property Rights. I occasionally write essays and book reviews for public facing periodicals and websites and have developed several case studies for Harvard Law School’s Case Studies Program. During 2016-2017, I was a Visiting Professor and Catalyst Fellow at Osgoode, and an adjunct faculty at Northeastern University School of Law. I hold an SJD, an interdisciplinary doctorate from Harvard Law School, LLMs from Harvard Law School and American University’s Washington College of Law, and a BA LLB (with honors) from the National University of Juridical Sciences, India. At Harvard, I received the Irving Oberman Memorial Environmental Law Prize and the Abram Chayes International Public Service Fellowship. I have also received research and advocacy fellowships from the Canadian Social Sciences and Research Council, the American Society for Legal History, the American Society for Environmental History, the Berkman-Klein Center for Internet and Society, Harvard University’s Office for Scholarly Communication, the Public International Law and Policy Group, the Center for International Environmental Law, Watson Institute for International Studies at Brown University. I have studied and worked in disaster management in central India, in the borderlands between India, Pakistan, and China, and in the Philippines. I have also trained and advised officials and civil society in India, Thailand, Canada, and at the United Nations. From 2006 to 2010, I was an associate with Radon & Ishizumi in New York and worked on pharmaceutical and biotechnology projects. During this time, I also advised public authorities and corporate clients on constitution development in Nepal and environmental policymaking in the Caucasus, respectively.

Professor Scott joined Osgoode’s faculty in 2006 after completing a SSHRC Post-Doctoral Fellowship at McGill’s Faculty of Law and a Hauser Global Research Fellowship at NYU. Professor Scott’s research interests focus on contestation over extraction; exercises of Indigenous jurisdiction over lands and resources; the distribution of pollution burdens affecting marginalized communities and vulnerable populations; gender and environmental health; and the justice dimensions of the transition to a greener economy. Professor Scott is currently the co-Principal Investigator, with Professor Heidi Kiiwetinepinesiik Stark of the University of Victoria’s Center for Indigenous Research and Community-led Engagement (CIRCLE), of a project funded by the SSHRC New Frontiers in Research Fund called “Jurisdiction Back: Infrastructure Beyond Extractivism”. In a partnership between the Yellowhead Institute, the University of Toronto’s Department of Geography and Planning and York University, this project includes 14 academics and land defenders from across the country pursuing research oriented towards how the “just transition” to sustainable economies can be imagined and infrastructured to restore Indigenous jurisdiction, laws and governance systems. Professor Scott has been the Primary Investigator on several SSHRC-funded projects, including “Consent & Contract: Authorizing Extraction in Ontario’s Ring of Fire” with colleagues Andrée Boisselle, Deborah McGregor and Estair Van Wagner, and the Partnership Development Grant, “Reconciling Sovereignties: New Techniques for ‘Authorizing’ Extraction on Indigenous Territories” led by Professor Shiri Pasternak, in partnership with the Indigenous Network on Economies and Trade (INET) and MiningWatch Canada. She also completed research in partnership with environmental justice activists from the Aamjiwnaang First Nation, near Sarnia`s Chemical Valley, that applied a critical, feminist perspective to the examination of law’s treatment of the risks of long-term, low-dose exposures to pollutants, and another SSHRC-funded project (“Investigating Regulatory Chill”) that examined constraints on regulation to protect the environment, with a focus on investor rights in the resource extraction context. Professor Scott and collaborators recently completed a major report for the Impact Assessment Agency of Canada entitled, “Implementing a Regional, Indigenous-Led, and Sustainability-Informed Impact Assessment in Ontario’s Ring of Fire.” This project was undertaken in partnership with Chief and Council of Neskantaga First Nation, a remote Anishinaabe community in Ontario’s far north..

Prior to assuming her role as Provost, Professor Moran served as the first female Dean of the Faculty of Law at the University of Toronto. As Dean, she led curriculum change, revised the admissions process and created the Asper Centre for Constitutional Rights and the Centre for the Legal Profession, among many other initiatives.  Her strong relationships with students, alumni and faculty led to her successful leadership of a $53 million campaign for the Faculty’s new Jackman Law Building.   Provost Moran has brought to Trinity College her commitment to students.  In 2016, she released the College’s new Strategic Plan: People, Program and Place, which builds upon the College’s reputation for academic excellence and interdisciplinary innovation and focuses on enhancing the whole student experience in order to make the College an even a better place to live, work and learn.  As Provost she has emphasized the student experience with initiatives ranging from mental health and wellness, to revitalized food services, to student services and program enhancements, to infrastructure renewal.Provost Moran’s teaching interests include both private and public law.  She continues to supervise graduate and undergraduate students.

      " Professor of Law, Political Science & Global Affairs, and former Canada Research Chair in Citizenship and Multiculturalism Jackman Law Building78 Queen's ParkToronto, Ontario M5S 2C5 Ayelet Shachar (FRSC) is Professor of Law, Political Science, and Global Affairs, and the holder of the R.F. Harney Chair in Ethnic, Immigration and Pluralism Studies at the University of Toronto, where she directs the Harney Program at the Munk School of Global Affairs & Public Policy. Previously, she was a Scientific Member of the Max Planck Society—one of the foremost research organizations in the world—and Director at the Max Planck Institute for the Study of Religious and Ethnic Diversity. She was awarded the Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize in 2019. Before her recruitment to the Max Planck Society, she held the Canada Research Chair in Citizenship and Multiculturalism. At Goethe University Frankfurt she is affiliated with both the Faculty of Law and the Normative Orders Research Centre, where she is the leader of the \"Transformations of Citizenship\" research group. Shachar has published extensively on the topics of citizenship theory, immigration law, cultural diversity and women's rights, new border regimes, highly skilled migration and global inequality, and the marketization of citizenship. Her research is motivated by the need to develop new legal principles to address some of the most pressing issues of our time: how to live together in diverse societies, how to grant rights to those who lack formal access to membership, and how to tame the ever-expanding reach of borders and migration control in a world of persistent inequality.Shachar is the author of Multicultural Jurisdictions: Cultural Differences and Women's Rights (Cambridge University Press, 2001 & 2009), for which she won the American Political Science Association 2002 Foundations of Political Theory Section Best First Book Award. This work has inspired a new generation of thinking about how to best mitigate the tensions between gender equality and religious diversity. It has also proved influential in the real world, intervening in actual public policy and legislative debates. It has been cited by, among others, England's Archbishop of Canterbury (who described Shachar's work as \"highly original and significant\"), Ontario's Ministry of the Attorney General, and the Supreme Court of Canada. Over the last twenty years, Multicultural Jurisdictions has become a key reference point for feminist approaches to the study of law and religion.Shachar's work combines \"big ideas\" from law and political theory with innovative problem-solving and institutional design. The Birthright Lottery: Citizenship and Global Inequality (Harvard University Press, 2009) was named 2010 International Ethics Notable Book in recognition of its \"superior scholarship and contribution to the field of international ethics.\" It has created a groundswell of interest among policymakers and academics alike. Located at the intersection of law, economics, and political philosophy, The Birthright Lottery crafts new legal concepts and innovative institutional designs to promote global justice, with the aim of ameliorating the most glaring opportunity inequalities that attach to this system of allocation in today's world. This work has been the topic of special-issue symposiums, international workshops and roundtables, and the subject of essays that have appeared in professional and interdisciplinary publications, including the American Journal of Comparative Law, Ethics & International Affairs, Harvard Law Review, Issues in Legal Scholarship, La Revue Nouvelle, Political Theory, Rorotoko, Nexus, Edge, Tikkun, and the Literary Review of Canada.  Shachar is also the lead editor of the field-defining The Oxford Handbook of Citizenship (Oxford University Press, 2017 & 2020). This work has already emerged as a major reference work in the field for those engaged with citizenship from a philosophical, political, legal and cultural perspective. It has been described by Joseph Weiler as: “The definitive source on a critical concept in political and social life. Innovative in its conception and authoritative in its excitation.” Pratap Mehta observes that “[n]o other single volume achieves the theoretical acuity, historical depth, legal grounding, and sociological analysis of citizenship that this book manages to achieve. It is clear, wide ranging, and admirably un-parochial in the range of its references.”Shachar newest book, The Shifting Border: Legal Cartographies of Migration and Mobility (Critical Powers Series, Manchester University Press, 2020; shortlisted for the 2022 C.B. Macpherson Prize), critically examines the role of territory and new measures of managed migration control in selectively restricting - or, conversely, accelerating - mobility and access to the world’s prosperous countries, as governments seek to regain control over a crucial realm of their allegedly waning sovereign authority. Here, as in her previous writings, Shachar not only reveals the deep currents that are reshaping the terrain of law and mobility, but also seeks to develop innovative legal responses to break the current deadlock as she seeks to refute the claim that applicable solutions are beyond reach or impossible to imagine. This work appears under the auspices of the Critical Powers Series, which is “dedicated to constructing dialogues around innovative and original work in social and political theory”.The Shifting Border has been described by Hiroshi Motomura as “a remarkable book. Essential for understanding government responses to people on the move, Shachar’s vivid description, analytical precision, and reasoned persuasion combine to challenge conventional wisdom about ‘borders’ and how they work. The result: exceptional insights into how migration control can be more just. The Shifting Border offers an indispensable roadmap to immigration and refugee debates all around the world\". A recent LSE book review opines: \"In her impressive book, The Shifting Border, Ayelet Shachar refuses to adhere to what she views as false dichotomies between traditional approaches to a concept (culture, citizenship, borders) and premature diagnoses of the concept’s demise. The force of her argument is consistently oriented towards rethinking the question, offering a new framework to understanding the world. … Shachar’s innovative framework nicely exemplifies the shift from idealized ethical debates to institutional and political analysis.\" \"Reading this essay by Shachar...is like getting the dream dinner invitation to hear cutting-edge thought on borders\" (CHOICE magazine).

Alon-Shenker’s research interests centre on labour and employment law with an emphasis on workplace discrimination and diversity, the aging workforce, and forms of employee representation and voice. Her research advances an innovative critique of contemporary legal analyses of age discrimination in the workplace and develops a new paradigm, founded in legal and philosophical theories of equality, which better articulates the wrongs associated with age discrimination in the workplace. This research also has significant practical implications for topical legal challenges faced by the aging workforce such as the duty to accommodate senior workers, mandatory retirement and cost-based defence claims. Her recent research projects expand to issues of diversity at work, intergenerational equity, and age & intersectionality. Alon-Shenker received the Dean’s Scholarly, Research and Creative Activity Award in 2014 for her scholarly achievements. In 2016, she received the Provost's Experiential Teaching Award in recognition of her work to develop and lead the Ryerson Law & Business Clinic.

      "Beverley Baines is a Professor of Public and Constitutional Law with a passion for illuminating the legal strategies the patriarchal state deploys to deny women their right to equality which is guaranteed in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Her passion dates from her involvement as a feminist constitutional consultant, first to the Canadian Advisory Council on the Status of Women and then to the Ad Hoc Committee of Women on the Constitution during the Charter debates of 1980-1982. Professor Baines earned a BA Hons (Economics and Political Science) from McGill and a JD from Queen’s, following which she articled with Trumpour and Kennedy in Kingston, joined Queen’s Law as a faculty member, was admitted to the Law Society of Upper Canada, and served as Associate Dean in the Faculty of Law (1994-1997).

      "Benjamin Ewing is an Assistant Professor at Queen’s Law. Prior to joining Queen’s, he was a Visiting Assistant Professor at Duke University School of Law. He earned his PhD in Politics from Princeton University, his JD from Yale Law School, and his AB in Applied Mathematics-Economics from Brown University, where he graduated magna cum laude. At Princeton, Ewing was a Laurance S. Rockefeller Graduate Prize Fellow in the University Center for Human Values. While a law student at Yale, he was a Coker Fellow and, in the fall of 2009, a research assistant to Associate Justice Stephen Breyer of the Supreme Court of the United States. In his scholarship, Ewing analyzes the moral and political foundations of different forms of legal responsibility for wrongdoing, particularly criminal punishment. He is especially interested in what it means to have a fair opportunity to avoid crime and punishment. He has developed a distinctive interpretation of fair opportunity to avoid crime that helps explain, among other things, the moral significance at sentencing of whether a defendant came from an unfairly disadvantaged background or committed prior offenses.

      "On leave in 2022-23 Joshua Karton teaches and writes about international dispute resolution (especially international commercial arbitration), international and comparative contract law, transnational legal theory, globalization and law, and linguistic issues in law. His writing explores what happens when private actors from different backgrounds—legal, cultural, and linguistic—meet in the international legal arena. Professor Karton has taught at Queen’s Law since 2009, and was until recently the Associate Dean for Graduate Studies and Research. He holds a BA from Yale, a JD from Columbia, a PhD from Cambridge, and a “Qualified Arbitrator” designation from the ADR Institute of Canada. Before commencing his academic career, he practiced in litigation and arbitration at Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP in New York. In 2022-23, he is the Tsai Wan-Tsai Visiting Chair Professor of International Law at the National Taiwan University College of Law. He has also held visiting positions at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Wuhan University, the University of Nagoya, and San Francisco de Quito University in Ecuador. Professor Karton is an internationally recognized expert on international dispute resolution especially international arbitration. He has written or edited four books and dozens of articles in his fields of interest, and has received wide recognition for his research, including most recently as an elected member of the International Academy of Comparative Law. Much of Professor Karton’s research is interdisciplinary, influenced in particular by sociological theories and methods. His sociology of the international arbitration field, The Culture of International Arbitration and the Evolution of Contract Law, was published in 2013 to great acclaim in the academic and practitioner press. Currently, he is a co-lead investigator on the largest-ever empirical study of international commercial arbitration practice, The Social and Psychological Underpinnings of Commercial Arbitration in Europe, funded by the UK Economic and Social Research Council. His most recent book, a co-edited volume, is Diversity in International Arbitration: Why it Matters and How to Sustain It. Professor Karton co-founded and remains the Managing Editor of the Canadian Journal of Commercial Arbitration, is a Book Review Editor of the American Journal of Comparative Law, a General Editor of Kluwer Arbitration Practical Insights (a leading online research guide for international arbitration practitioners), and sits on the editorial advisory committees of several other journals and blogs. He was formerly a member of the Executive Committee of the American Society of Comparative Law, and Chair of its Younger Comparativists Committee. Aside from his scholarly activities, Professor Karton practices as an independent arbitrator and legal consultant. He is deeply involved in professional organizations in the arbitration and comparative law fields, especially in training and capacity-building programs. He is a Vice Chair of the Institute for Transnational Arbitration's Academic Council, a member of the core faculty of the Toronto Commercial Arbitration Society's “Gold Standard” course in arbitration, an instructor and advisory board member of the Africa Arbitration Academy, and a member of the board of directors of the Vis East Foundation, the non-profit that operates the Willem C. Vis International Commercial Arbitration Moot East in Hong Kong. A winner of Queen’s Law Student Society Award for Teaching Excellence, Professor Karton is passionately dedicated to teaching. He is particularly proud of his involvement with the Vis Moot, at which he has coached four different universities to prize-winning results. A proficient speaker of French and Chinese, he is a member of the New York bar and his application to the Law Society of Ontario is pending.

      "Kathleen Lahey is Professor and Queen's National Scholar, Faculty of Law, Queen's University, Co-director, Feminist Legal Studies Queen’s, cross-appointed to Queen’s Gender Studies, and affiliated faculty, Queen's Cultural Studies Interdisciplinary Graduate Program. She is a member of the Ontario and Illinois bars, Associate member, Garden Court Chambers, UK, sits on the boards of the UK-based Tax Justice Network and the steering committee of its global parent, the Global Alliance for Tax Justice, and specializes in tax, corporate, gender, international tax, property, and human rights law. Her current research revolves around three core questions: Until substantive equality of outcomes for all individuals can be attained, how can societies eliminate deeply- rooted structural inequalities and discriminatory practices? How can the power and wealth concentrated in global 'north' corporations and individuals through unequal property, political, tax, and budget laws be replaced with redistributive programs that maintain individual sustain/abilities throughout life? And, what truths arise from Indigenous and diverse peoples' living knowledges and learnings about how to match rates of human innovation and development with the evolutionary rates of other members of the biosphere in order to increase the sustain/abilities of all forms of life? She has pursued these questions while on numerous government commissions, while meeting with and advising governments, civil society, academic groups in Canada, across China and on every continent, as well as when working with the European Parliament, EU governments, the UN and other treaty bodies, international financial institutions, and with Indigenous, circumpolar Arctic, human rights, and diverse peoples' organizations, watching and learning how to expand current research and dissemination methods capable of addressing these increasingly urgent issues.

      "Research Areas Surveillance and Social Sorting; Big Data Surveillance; Identification Regimes; Privacy; Information Technologies; Christian Social Critique David Lyon's research, writing, and teaching interests revolve around major social transformations in the modern world. Questions of the information society, globalization, secularization, surveillance, and debates over “post-” and “digital” modernity feature prominently in his work. Lyon was formerly an editor of Surveillance & Society and is Associate Editor of The Information Society. He also serves on the international editorial boards of several other journals. His books have been translated into seventeen languages: Arabic, Chinese, Czech, Danish, Dutch, Farsi, German, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Spanish, Swedish and Turkish. Surveillance Surveillance Studies has been Lyon’s major research area for the past 25 years. He brings a sociological perspective to bear on the issues raised by personal data processing in a database-dependent world. His surveillance interests include border and airport controls, social media, organizational routines, video camera surveillance, citizen registration and identification systems and social media. His concerns include, prominently, the social sorting capacities of contemporary surveillance, along with an exploration of their ethics and politics. From the mid-1980s, Lyon's broad concerns prompted a critical examination of the much-hyped ‘microelectronics revolution’ that gave way to the so-called ‘information society.’ In the 1990s, Lyon focused his analyses on the social origins, incidence and consequences of processing personal data, arguing that surveillance has become a major dimension of modernity in its own right. This aspect of his research has expanded considerably, especially since 9/11, and involves extensive collaboration with colleagues and students. Surveillance is a globalized phenomenon, and Lyon's work focuses increasingly on the global south and on encouraging the development of Surveillance Studies networks around the world. From 2008-2010 David Lyon was a Canada Council Killam Research Fellow, investigating the current rise of national ID card systems in a cross-national comparative perspective. The work complements some of his other studies of surveillance and contributes to both empirical and theoretical understanding of contemporary smart, biometrics-based ID systems. Currently, Lyon is working towards a book entitled Surveillance: A Very Short Introduction and another on surveillance critique, The Eye of God. David Lyon and Surveillance Secularization While he is best known for his work in Surveillance Studies, David Lyon’s research and writing span several other areas as well. Starting in Historical Sociology in the 1970s, his early work was on secularization processes – and the critique of some key theories -- in the modern world. Today, he tries to keep abreast of debates over the \"post-secular\" with an emphasis on the work of Charles Taylor. Following this, his main research directions explore other forms of social transformation that are both characteristic and constitutive of modernity. Research and Students As Director of the Surveillance Studies Centre, Lyon works with a multidisciplinary and international team on several related initiatives from primary research to theoretical development as well as associated media, policy and advocacy activities. The current team project is on “Big Data Surveillance” (2015-2020) and is funded by the SSHRC Partnership Grant program. It has streams on security, marketing and governance. This offers opportunities for a number of PhD students and postdoctoral fellows within Sociology. He continues to supervise and co-supervise PhDs. Recognition In 2020, Lyon received the Molson Prize, Canada Council for the Arts. In 2018, Lyon received the Surveillance Studies Network Outstanding Contribution Award. In 2017, Lyon received a Queen's University Award for Excellence in Graduate Supervision. In 2005, Lyon was awarded a Queen’s Research Chair in Surveillance Studies. In 2007 Lyon received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the American Sociological Association Communication and Information Technology Section and in 2008 he was elected Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada. In 2012 he received an Outstanding Achievement Award from the Canadian Sociological Association, in 2015 an Insight-Impact Award from the SSHRC and in 2016 an honorary doctorate from the Università della Svizzera Italiana in Switzerland. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IlkVONwSbQ Publications Surveillance Big Data Surveillance and Security Intelligence (edited with David Murakami Wood) UBC Press 2020.

      "Cherie Metcalf is an Associate Professor at Queen’s University in the Faculty of Law and the Department of Economics (cross-appointment). She completed her undergraduate degree at Queen’s before earning postgraduate degrees in Economics (MA, PhD) at the University of British Columbia, later returning to Queen’s to obtain her LLB. Following completion of her LL.B., she clerked at the Federal Court of Appeal and for former Justice Ian Binnie at the Supreme Court of Canada. She then completed her LLM at Yale on a Fulbright scholarship before joining the faculty. Professor Metcalf’s research often draws on her graduate training in economics. She has used economic theory and empirical methods to study Indigenous rights, including the Supreme Court’s s. 35 Aboriginal rights cases, considering impacts on governance, rights holders and resource industry participants. Another research strand relates to the role of law, especially constitutional rights, in influencing individuals’ decisions, preferences and broader social norms. Professor Metcalf also studies issues in environmental and resource law more generally and her most recent work is focused on climate change. Her research has been published in journals including the Northwestern University Law Review, International Review of Law & Economics, Canadian Public Policy, University of Toronto Law Journal, Journal of Empirical Legal Studies, & Queen’s Law Journal. Together with her co-author, Ian Keay, she was twice awarded the Vanderkamp prize for best paper in Canadian Public Policy. She frequently presents her work internationally at conferences and invited seminars. She has recently received grants from the Social Science & Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC) and the Canadian Foundation for Legal Research. She has been an invited visiting scholar at the University of Colorado Faculty of Law & Institute of Behavioral Sciences Institutions Program, and Vancouver School of Economics at UBC. Professor Metcalf’s teaching at Queen’s spans the areas of her research interests, and includes public law, constitutional law, law and economics, international environmental and resource law and (occasionally) property law. She has also coached the Queen’s Laskin moot team, together with Queen’s Law alumna Pam Hrick (LEAF). She served as Associate Dean Academic at the faculty from 2015-2018.

      "Professor Pardy is a classically liberal legal academic for whom equal application of the law, negative rights, private property, limited government, and separation of powers are foundational to the Canadian and Western legal tradition. A critic of legal progressivism, social justice, and the discretionary administrative state, he has written on a range of pressing legal subjects at the front lines of the culture war inside the law, including environmental governance, climate change, energy policy, human rights and freedoms, professional and university governance, property and tort theory, free markets, and the rule of law. He has taught at law schools in Canada, the United States and New Zealand, practiced civil litigation at Borden Ladner Gervais LLP in Toronto, served as adjudicator and mediator on the Ontario Environmental Review Tribunal, and has published and commented widely in traditional and online media. He serves as senior fellow at the Fraser Institute, and helped to birth the Runnymede Society, a branch of the Canadian Constitution Foundation. He spearheaded resistance to and ultimate repeal of the Law Society of Ontario’s statement of principles (SOP) policy that required Ontario lawyers to attest to their ideological purity to maintain their licence to practice. He is one of the co-creators of the Free North Declaration, a public petition and movement to protect civil liberties in Canada from COVID-19 irrationality and overreach. Professor Pardy is presently on leave from Queen’s Law to serve as the Executive Director of Rights Probe, a division of the Energy Probe Research Foundation, one of Canada’s leading public policy and governance thinktanks.

      "Education BA, University of Toronto MA, University of Toronto DPhil, Oxford University Specializations / Research Interests Political Philosophy, Philosophy of Law, Feminist Philosophy Personal Website About Christine Sypnowich found her path to political philosophy when she encountered the work of C.B. Macpherson at the University of Toronto, where she completed her first two degrees before taking up a Commonwealth Scholarship to do a doctorate at Balliol College, Oxford. Sypnowich has held teaching appointments at Oxford University, Leeds University, Leiden University, University of California (San Diego), and York University, before coming to Queen’s. She has been awarded visiting fellowships at the Australian National University, Corpus Christi College, Oxford, and All Souls College, Oxford. She is also a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada. Christine Sypnowich’s early work was in the philosophy of law, particularly the possibility of socialist legality given the Marxist antipathy to law. This was the subject of her first monograph published with OUP, a revised version of her Oxford dissertation. More recently her research has centred on egalitarianism, making the case for a human flourishing approach to equality in Equality Renewed: Justice, Human Flourishing and the Egalitarian Ideal (Routledge 2018). She has published over 60 essays as journal articles or book chapters. Her work has been translated into Chinese, Russian and Spanish and abridged versions published in accessible formats such as textbooks and popular philosophy. She is currently completing a book on the philosophy of G.A. Cohen for Polity Press. Active in the city of Kingston as an advocate for transparency at City Hall as well as heritage conservation, Sypnowich is also working on a monograph on the political philosophy of cultural heritage.

He has focused particularly on the forces that shape competing perspectives (both domestically and internationally) on the roles and responsibilities of corporations, boards of directors and different stakeholders, and that in turn influence the institutional structures that countries put in place to oversee and foster the evolution of business law. After clerking for Justice Bertha Wilson at the Supreme Court of Canada (1989-90), Robert was called to the Bar in Ontario (1991) and Quebec (1992). He joined Osler’s Toronto office in 1993, became a partner in 1998, and was part of the team that opened Osler’s Montreal office in 2001. Fluently bilingual, he served as a member of Osler's Executive Committee, as Co-Chair of Osler’s National Mergers and Acquisitions Group for over a decade and as the head of the Corporate Department in Osler’s Montreal office. Repeatedly recognized as one of Canada’s leading business lawyers during his 25 years in practice, Robert worked closely with senior management teams and boards of directors in shaping some of Canada’s most innovative and ground-breaking transactions.

      "Ellen B. Zweibel, Professor and Co-Founding Director of the Legal Writing Academy at the University of Ottawa Faculty of Law. LL.M Tax Law (Denver University, 1981); J.D., cum laude (Booklyn Law School,1974) and B.A. English, cum laude ( SUNY at Stony Brook,1970). Professional training in conflict resolution, negotiation, mediation, dispute resolution systems design, and collaborative processes for public policy disputes includes courses at CDR Associates, (Boulder); CIIAN (Ottawa), and PON at Harvard (Boston). Everyone needs left and right brain activity. I exercise my left-brain teaching Introduction to Income Tax and my right-brain creating, organizing, and teaching the experiential learning-based Dispute Resolution and Professional Responsibility program for all first-year law students. The Legal Writing Academy occupies both my left and right brain continuously. Over thirty-five years I’ve done a lot of stuff. You don’t really want to read a list of my book chapters, articles, and presentations. So, I’ll just pick some of teaching, research, and writing examples that are highlights for me and that tell you something about what makes me tick. Teaching - A few of my absolutely favourite things Take Tax-You Won’t Regret It Tax is my absolute favourite course to teach. At some point, every aspect of law and public policy intersects with tax and tax policy. Students in my tax class pick up a new vocabulary, learn to read and apply complex statutory provisions, and to research and write about the tax aspects of a social-economic issue of their choice. I’m working on an online version of intro tax that you can take at your own pace over the summer or as a month-long intensive. Zealous Advocates Use Dispute Resolution Processes to Get Their Clients the Best Outcomes Forget what popular culture says about lawyers as voracious litigators. Although I love a good TV court room drama, in reality, the experience of going to court might be exhilarating for lawyers, but never for clients. In your legal career you’ll likely represent plaintiffs and defendants in many court actions, and you’ll likely argue many preliminary motions, but mostly you’ll achieve your client’s objectives negotiating deals and settlements or working with a mediator to resolve disputes. And that’s why my absolute favourite thing is designing the experiential learning activities for our first year Dispute Resolution and Professional Responsibility course where we introduce basic conflict analysis, interviewing, negotiation, and mediation advocacy skills along with professional responsibility and ethics. The DRPR course puts the substantive law you learn in other first-year courses into the context of real client problems and real ethical dilemmas. You’ll interview clients, consider multiple approaches and solutions to client situations, choose among dispute resolution processes, negotiate and mediate agreements and disputes, practice oral advocacy in a non-litigation setting, and write a case analysis memo on a professional responsibility problem and a client advice letter. You’ll become familiar with the Rules of Professional Conduct, grapple with ethical dilemmas, and consider what it takes to be culturally competent and to ensure access to justice. And, in keeping with the new reality of lawyer’s work, you’ll learn both in person and online skills. DRPR is my signature course. I introduced it over 25 years ago. The course is as real as we can make it. We train upper-year students as clients and each year over 50 legal practitioners participate as demonstrators and coaches for our capstone activity. And because the course always incorporated online learning strategies, when the Covid 19 shut down in-person courses, we had the know how to pivot to fully online course delivery. As a bonus for me, I’ve used my dispute resolution skills to design and deliver courses to medical professionals and medical trainees on “raising conflict productively” and negotiation. Great Lawyers are Great Writers – The Legal Writing Academy Now, my other absolute favourite thing is the Legal Writing Academy programing. Here’s where I combine my passion for pedagogy with ensuring that UOttawa law graduates are confident and competent writers. The ability to write clearly, concisely, and persuasively is a core competence for every lawyer regardless of their career path. I take pride in our first-year workshops, DRPR writing modules, Civil Procedure memo module, Writing Leader’s program, Dean’s Fellows, Social Justice writing courses, and ten, upper-year Write with Purpose seminars. Students can meet with an upper-year Writing Leader to work on strategies to overcome writer’s block and recognize, correct, and avoid typical writing problems. And our award-winning www.Pointfirstwriting.com website gives you just-in-time access to modules on writing legal memo and editing your own work. Experiential learning drives every component of the Legal Academy programming.

My Three Favourite Research Projects – Projects that Stretched my Brain Charitable Gifts of Conservation Easements: Lessons from the US Experience in Enhancing the Tax Incentive, Canadian Tax Journal (2010) vol. 58, no 1, 25 - 61 (co-author Karen Cooper). Researching the impact of the charitable tax credit on preserving eco-sensitive land let me delve into the science and economics of ecosystem services, climate change, environmental and behavioural economics. I learned a lot. A second branch of the project became a series of presentations that we thought had more punch than an academic article. What Sticks: How Medical Residents and Academic Health Care Faculty Transfer Conflict Resolution Training from the Workshop to the Workplace (Spring 2008) 3:25 Conflict Resolution Quarterly 321-350 (co-authors Goldstein, R, Manwaring, J. Marks, M.). Working with the faculty of medicine on training medical faculty and residents in raising conflict productively, led to an interdisciplinary study of what program participants actually took away and could apply in their work at the hospital and on research team. I learned new social science research techniques. The research had a double-back effect; we learned what worked and what we could change for greater impact. Legal Memos Made Easy and Edit Your Own Work on www.Pointfirstwriting.com These companion modules teach the practical skills of writing legal memos and a five-layered approach to editing. Each layer concentrates on a different task, keeping students and other users from being overwhelmed by fixing everything at once. Chunked sub-parts allow students to practice skills multiple times on a variety of documents and apply online feedback incrementally to drafts. The website is used in writing seminars and to support students writing assignments and major papers. Students can self-study anytime. And graduates tell us they return to the website in their first years of practice and share the site with colleagues at work. The website content and activities reflect years of studying how we learn and delving into online learning strategies. Teaching Awards – We don’t teach or innovate for awards.

      "Professor O’Toole teaches Aboriginal Law, Indigenous Legal Philosophy, and Philosophy of Law. Throughout his studies in Political Science, Professor O’Toole maintained an interest in Canadian Politics, the History of Political Ideas, Political Economy, Methodology and Epistemology. A descendant of the Bois-Brûlé (Wiisakodewininiwag) of the White Horse Plains in Manitoba, who in 1870 foisted upon the nascent Dominion of Canada the first French common law jurisdiction in the British Empire, Professor O’Toole studied the common law in French at the Université de Moncton. After completing his law degree, Professor O’Toole completed a Ph.D. dissertation involving an analysis of the “discourse” of the Métis Resistance in 1869-70 that reveals republican conventions both in both speech and act. Professor O’Toole’s published research has focused on the land claims of his Métis ancestors that led to the Manitoba Métis Federation v. Canada and Manitoba case. His current research explores the Anishinabek legal order, for which he received Grant from University of Ottawa’s Research Development Programme in 2012-2013. His work on Indigenous law, notably in terms of relations with the land and self-determination, has led to an interest in legal anthropology and legal pluralism SSRN Homepage\n",
