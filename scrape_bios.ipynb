I hold a B.A. from Concordia University, an LL.B./B.C.L. from McGill University and a D.Phil. from the University of Oxford. In 2007-2008, I clerked for the Hon. Justice Ian Binnie at the Supreme Court of Canada. After this I worked as an associate attorney in litigation in the New York office of Ropes & Gray, LLP. I was called to the Bars in Ontario and in New York in 2009. My doctoral work focussed on philosophical questions related to corporate-entity crime, such as what it means to form an intention as a group, and how to apply the criminal law’s principles of moral responsibility to non-natural persons. During my DPhil, I taught at Christ Church College and St Catharine’s College, Oxford, and worked as a researcher at the Sentencing Council for England and Wales. My DPhil research was supported by the Fonds de recherche Québec: Société et Culture. After finishing my doctorate, I worked as a senior advisor to the Director General of Environmental Enforcement at Environment and Climate Change Canada on topics that were a practical corollary to the theoretical questions of my DPhil, namely principles of exculpation and sentencing for corporate environmental offenders. This led to other work in environmental policy at Transport Canada and at ECCC. My academic articles have appeared in Criminal Law and Philosophy and The Canadian Journal of Law and Jurisprudence.

      "Originally from Vancouver, British Columbia, I attended UBC where I studied French and Italian language and literature. After completing an LL.M. and a Ph.D. in International Law at the University of Cambridge in the U.K., I finished my LL.B. at Dalhousie University. I was called to the British Columbia Bar and practiced corporate and commercial law at McCarthy Tétrault LLP in Vancouver. I subsequently worked in the nongovernmental sector on peace and disarmament issues. It was during this time that I participated in the Canadian Assessment Mission to Sudan (the Harker Mission) which was established and dispatched by Canada's Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Trade to investigate allegations of slavery, as well as, links between oil development in Sudan and grave violations of human rights. Prior to coming to the University of Ottawa in 2007, I was a Senior Lecturer in Law at Oxford Brookes University in the UK. My research is focused on the human rights implications of domestic and transnational business activity and particularly on natural resource extraction, and how best to regulate such activity to protect human rights and prevent and mitigate other harm. I also consider the intersections between transnational corporate activity, human rights and international economic law. My current work is on gender and resource extraction.\n",

      "Ellen B. Zweibel, Professor and Co-Founding Director of the Legal Writing Academy at the University of Ottawa Faculty of Law. LL.M Tax Law (Denver University, 1981); J.D., cum laude (Booklyn Law School,1974) and B.A. English, cum laude ( SUNY at Stony Brook,1970). Professional training in conflict resolution, negotiation, mediation, dispute resolution systems design, and collaborative processes for public policy disputes includes courses at CDR Associates, (Boulder); CIIAN (Ottawa), and PON at Harvard (Boston). Everyone needs left and right brain activity. I exercise my left-brain teaching Introduction to Income Tax and my right-brain creating, organizing, and teaching the experiential learning-based Dispute Resolution and Professional Responsibility program for all first-year law students. The Legal Writing Academy occupies both my left and right brain continuously. Over thirty-five years I’ve done a lot of stuff. You don’t really want to read a list of my book chapters, articles, and presentations. So, I’ll just pick some of teaching, research, and writing examples that are highlights for me and that tell you something about what makes me tick. Teaching - A few of my absolutely favourite things Take Tax-You Won’t Regret It Tax is my absolute favourite course to teach. At some point, every aspect of law and public policy intersects with tax and tax policy. Students in my tax class pick up a new vocabulary, learn to read and apply complex statutory provisions, and to research and write about the tax aspects of a social-economic issue of their choice. I’m working on an online version of intro tax that you can take at your own pace over the summer or as a month-long intensive. Zealous Advocates Use Dispute Resolution Processes to Get Their Clients the Best Outcomes Forget what popular culture says about lawyers as voracious litigators. Although I love a good TV court room drama, in reality, the experience of going to court might be exhilarating for lawyers, but never for clients. In your legal career you’ll likely represent plaintiffs and defendants in many court actions, and you’ll likely argue many preliminary motions, but mostly you’ll achieve your client’s objectives negotiating deals and settlements or working with a mediator to resolve disputes. And that’s why my absolute favourite thing is designing the experiential learning activities for our first year Dispute Resolution and Professional Responsibility course where we introduce basic conflict analysis, interviewing, negotiation, and mediation advocacy skills along with professional responsibility and ethics. The DRPR course puts the substantive law you learn in other first-year courses into the context of real client problems and real ethical dilemmas. You’ll interview clients, consider multiple approaches and solutions to client situations, choose among dispute resolution processes, negotiate and mediate agreements and disputes, practice oral advocacy in a non-litigation setting, and write a case analysis memo on a professional responsibility problem and a client advice letter. You’ll become familiar with the Rules of Professional Conduct, grapple with ethical dilemmas, and consider what it takes to be culturally competent and to ensure access to justice. And, in keeping with the new reality of lawyer’s work, you’ll learn both in person and online skills. DRPR is my signature course. I introduced it over 25 years ago. The course is as real as we can make it. We train upper-year students as clients and each year over 50 legal practitioners participate as demonstrators and coaches for our capstone activity. And because the course always incorporated online learning strategies, when the Covid 19 shut down in-person courses, we had the know how to pivot to fully online course delivery. As a bonus for me, I’ve used my dispute resolution skills to design and deliver courses to medical professionals and medical trainees on “raising conflict productively” and negotiation. Great Lawyers are Great Writers – The Legal Writing Academy Now, my other absolute favourite thing is the Legal Writing Academy programing. Here’s where I combine my passion for pedagogy with ensuring that UOttawa law graduates are confident and competent writers. The ability to write clearly, concisely, and persuasively is a core competence for every lawyer regardless of their career path. I take pride in our first-year workshops, DRPR writing modules, Civil Procedure memo module, Writing Leader’s program, Dean’s Fellows, Social Justice writing courses, and ten, upper-year Write with Purpose seminars. Students can meet with an upper-year Writing Leader to work on strategies to overcome writer’s block and recognize, correct, and avoid typical writing problems. And our award-winning www.Pointfirstwriting.com website gives you just-in-time access to modules on writing legal memo and editing your own work. Experiential learning drives every component of the Legal Academy programming. We combine real life writing tasks with personalized and frequent feedback and mentoring, and presentations by practitioner experts. We emphasize student self-reflection, goal setting, and life-long learning strategies. We pilot new courses and new approaches to writing instruction. We’ve run our first online summer course, Legal Memos Made Easy, designed for students to study at their own pace while working full time. Stay tuned for new initiatives. My Three Favourite Research Projects – Projects that Stretched my Brain Charitable Gifts of Conservation Easements: Lessons from the US Experience in Enhancing the Tax Incentive, Canadian Tax Journal (2010) vol. 58, no 1, 25 - 61 (co-author Karen Cooper). Researching the impact of the charitable tax credit on preserving eco-sensitive land let me delve into the science and economics of ecosystem services, climate change, environmental and behavioural economics. I learned a lot. A second branch of the project became a series of presentations that we thought had more punch than an academic article. What Sticks: How Medical Residents and Academic Health Care Faculty Transfer Conflict Resolution Training from the Workshop to the Workplace (Spring 2008) 3:25 Conflict Resolution Quarterly 321-350 (co-authors Goldstein, R, Manwaring, J. Marks, M.). Working with the faculty of medicine on training medical faculty and residents in raising conflict productively, led to an interdisciplinary study of what program participants actually took away and could apply in their work at the hospital and on research team. I learned new social science research techniques. The research had a double-back effect; we learned what worked and what we could change for greater impact. Legal Memos Made Easy and Edit Your Own Work on www.Pointfirstwriting.com These companion modules teach the practical skills of writing legal memos and a five-layered approach to editing. Each layer concentrates on a different task, keeping students and other users from being overwhelmed by fixing everything at once. Chunked sub-parts allow students to practice skills multiple times on a variety of documents and apply online feedback incrementally to drafts. The website is used in writing seminars and to support students writing assignments and major papers. Students can self-study anytime. And graduates tell us they return to the website in their first years of practice and share the site with colleagues at work. The website content and activities reflect years of studying how we learn and delving into online learning strategies. Teaching Awards – We don’t teach or innovate for awards.

      "Stéphane Sérafin is a graduate of the Programme de droit canadien (PDC) at the University of Ottawa and holds a Master of Laws from the University of Toronto. He is also a member of the Law Society of Ontario and the Barreau du Québec and has previously worked in private practice in the areas of aboriginal law, commercial law and civil litigation. Professor Sérafin’s research relates primarily to private law theory, with a particular emphasis on the relationship between contract and property law within the common law tradition. His perspective on the topic is shaped most notably by his bijural background and by his interest in comparative law, legal history and moral and political philosophy. Before joining the Common Law Section, he also worked as a law clerk at the Federal Court, as a part time professor at Carleton University, and was an Editor of the Ottawa Law Review.

      "João Velloso teaches sentencing and “sanctioning”, legal research methods, criminology and socio-legal studies. He has a multidisciplinary background in law, criminology, sociology, anthropology and communication. He works in the areas of criminal law and sentencing, critical criminology and socio-legal studies, more particularly sociology and anthropology of law. His empirical research deals with the penalization of protesters and migrants (deportation and detention), access to justice in detention, and the regulation of cannabis. He is particularly interested in the governance of security through the use of administrative law and the deterioration of rights resulting from these penal configurations that operate alternatively and in addition to criminal justice. Dr. Velloso is a member of the uOttawa Human Rights Research and Education Centre and and he participates in different Canadian and international research networks and projects, such as: Access to Law and Access to Justice (www.adaj.ca), Institute of Comparative Studies in Conflict Management (http://www.ineac.uff.br/), Canadian Partnership for International Justice (https://cpij-pcji.ca/), Observatory Violence, Criminalization and Democracy in Latin America (http://ovcd.org/), Ottawa Hub for Reduction Network (www.lessharms.ca), Observatory on Profiling (https://profilages.info/), and Prison Transparency Project (https://carleton.ca/prisontransparencyproject/).\n",
